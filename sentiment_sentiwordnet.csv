They think it’s a fast money move to buy crypto from a famous person. They think they can potentially ape that coin to profit a lot.  3. If I remember correctly, before the launch, they did a pre-launch which allows people buy coins or to get it from the developers. When it launches somehow the token chart pumped a lot making people want to sell the token but it got locked and it dumped. In a result according to bubblemaps twitter page, it’s actually been reported that the wallet are holding 90% (if I remember correctly, it’s the investor, team members, etc that withdrew from their wallets) that controls the coin that would dump.

But look at the transfer of wealth from the lower classes to the upper classes that took place.  You're saying you want a more extreme version of that to happen? That would make these problems worse, not better. And besides, it's an example of how medical technology has progressed enough that another plague will never happen.  Like I get that it seems like a good idea to ""reduce the number of people I don't like and things will magically get better"". But take a moment to reflect on the past and look at who will be affected. Only poor and vulnerable people will die. It won't magically target stupid people or evil people.

2024-12-06 00:48:03,"I'll let you know when they get passed , but I'm most excited that a Democrat isnt in to shovel money to Ukraine or bus illegal aliens in and give them EBT , hotels , etc.  I can garranty we won't be finding anything gender studies in this country or any other, the list could go on for a long book.  With a little cooperation a business man will balance the budget and probably have something left. The country is a corporation , normal businesses can't just print money and keep borrowing that's all Biden did his 4 years. They all have for the last 30 years but him more than any.  Trump has either fear or respect to make the rest of the world fall in line with what he wants to happen because they don't know if he would hit that button or not but they don't want to find out.  As far as the civil war question , it was one that a liberal presented to me and I was kind of impressed with him he openly said the country had more conservatives than liberals and it would be no contest.  Trying to scare a stranger over bs social media where everyone is somewhat anonymous is not something I would wast my time on.  Looking at all social media and random interviews ,polls, etc the liberal part of the country is not nearly as large as you believe it to be .    In reality a civil war would be so quick it couldn't even be called a war.  Liberal Democrats would be extinct within a week probably less and believe it or not you were pretty close to witnessing one.  If there would have been any funny business in this election, even a questionable video it would have happened , no judges deciding no lawyers involved , law enforcement wouldn't have come to the rescue.  I'd say even military and national guard would have sat it out because they hated Biden and definitely didn't like Kamala . Also conservative America does have more weapons than the worlds militaries combined, now I read that in some left leaning media so I'd say it's fairly accurate and considering I know what just the people in my little town have and I've had a buddy in the national guard say he was coming to my place if anything ever broke out that he would have a better chance here because I had cooler toys .    My point in all this and I'm wrapping up what I'm doing so I'm tired of talking to this phone is I would suggest opening that mind up to the possibility that trump does some good , no he's not gonna give another thought to trans rights to compete in women's events or anything resembling mental illness that thinks that's ok. But the meat and potatoes of what is really important to make sure the country continues and isn't third world for future generations he will do good, and also your not gonna get a chance to see a Democrat in the presidency for a very long time , Biden ensured that for y'all. So you can either try to adopt a positive outlook or be miserable for a pretty long time.  Try to look at others points of view without being so full of hate of one man because like it or not he will be your president and calling supporters stupid etc. will probably only provoke the wrong one and bad stuff will happen .  Unless your only outspoken on anonymous social media then your probably safe unless you find someone with more time on there hands and crazy , also has know how and toys that can find you regardless of VPN or anonymous sites.  Most conservatives have much more stuff to accomplish but there are the ones that don't and get pissed over these B's sites.  Either way I leave you with a have a good one and hopefully your new president.

The [UK National Curriculum](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study) emphasises this, too:  > **Statistics** >  > Pupils should be taught to: >  > - calculate and interpret the mean as an average  If you only consider American resources reputable, just google ""AP Statistics average definition"" and you will find plenty of resources saying the same, [such as this one](https://library.fiveable.me/key-terms/ap-stats/average).

Wiktionary elaborates:   > (mathematics, statistics): The term average may refer to the statistical mean, median or mode of a batch, sample, or distribution, or sometimes any other measure of central tendency. Statisticians and responsible news sources are careful to use whichever of these specific terms is appropriate. In common usage, average refers to the arithmetic mean. It is, however, a common rhetorical trick to call the most favorable of mean, median and mode the ""average"" depending on the interpretation of a set of figures that the speaker or writer wants to promote.  I will add that no actual statistician presenting results in academic literature is using the term ""average"" without exactly describing what sense they're using it in. In general, we formulate it as the *expectation* (essentially the arithmetic mean) of some probability distribution / random variable. For example, given a discrete random variable X, the expectation E(X) is what you would conventionally call the (arithmetic) mean, and e^(E[ln{X}]) is the geometric mean.",site staterun educational resource follows exam board specification textbook constitute reputable goalpost close together definition average measure central tendency national curriculum emphasis statistic pupil taught calculate interpret mean average consider american resource reputable google statistic average definition find plenty resource saying dictionary agree merriamwebster single mean mode median summarizes represents general significance set unequal value wiktionary statistic measure central tendency especially mean median mode wiktionary elaborates mathematics statistic term average may refer statistical mean median mode batch sample distribution sometimes measure central tendency statistician responsible news source careful whichever specific term appropriate common usage average refers arithmetic mean however common rhetorical trick call favorable mean median mode average depending interpretation set figure speaker writer want promote add actual statistician presenting result academic literature term average without exactly describing sense theyre general formulate expectation essentially arithmetic mean probability distribution random variable given discrete random variable expectation conventionally call arithmetic mean eelnx geometric mean,-0.09716117216117216,negative,0.9062,Positive,0.065625,Positive

2024-12-30 23:21:08,"By the way, congrats on your find.  I found that I have at least negative hundreds of millions of dollars from old lost bitcoins from way back.  Or rather, I have lost bitcoins that today are worth at least hundreds of millions of dollars. Exciting find, to remember that old traumatic experience.  The wallets and computers they were on were completely destroyed. All gone. Nothing left. Total loss. I have drunken migrant worker neighbors who broke in and entered into my place when I was away, to blame. I won't write their nationality here because I don't want to throw shade on their culture like that. It just is more than a little ironic that some of them have relatives who move a lot of fortune cookies.   At the time, the bitcoins were worth practically nothing. The electricity to mine them cost more than they were worth. So that part was not traumatic. Frankly the lost bitcoins were not even an afterthought given all the other bad things related to that break-in (tons of damaged property, a big mess to clean, time and money to clean, organize, fix and replace stuff, etc).  What was traumatic is that the people who broke in and entered, left my front door open, and let my dog out, and when I returned, at first I could not find him, and given who they were (the evidence made it easy to determine whodunnit), and where we were, I was terribly afraid my dog's days were done. Fortunately I was wrong about that and he was just sleeping in the corner of the yard (or wandering around in it?) which I only went to after running around the whole neighborhood looking for him in a panic.   At least that's what I think happened and where I eventually found him alive and well, if I recall correctly. Memory can suppress trauma in funny ways especially after so many years. Thankfully I still have it all written down somewhere, and I still have not lost that information. I'd have been better off if I'd not lost all those bitcoins, but hey, at least I have a traumatic experience to remember it by.  Other than that, they were mostly harmless neighbors, most of the time, except for all the damage they did to my place. And they were only rude, extremely loud and obnoxious about 33.7% of the time.  And I never even got to send any of my bitcoins to that Nigerian prince for his sister and her girlfriend.",congrats find found least negative hundred million dollar lost bitcoins rather lost bitcoins today worth least hundred million dollar exciting find remember traumatic experience wallet computer completely destroyed gone nothing left total loss drunken migrant worker neighbor broke entered place away blame write nationality throw shade culture ironic relative move fortune cooky bitcoins worth practically nothing electricity mine cost worth part not_traumatic frankly lost bitcoins not_even afterthought given related breakin ton damaged property mess clean money clean organize fix replace stuff traumatic broke entered left front door open let dog returned first not_find given evidence made easy determine whodunnit terribly afraid dog day done fortunately wrong sleeping corner yard wandering around went running around whole neighborhood looking panic least thats happened eventually found alive recall correctly memory suppress trauma funny way especially year thankfully written somewhere not_lost information better not_lost bitcoins hey least traumatic experience remember mostly harmless neighbor except damage place rude extremely loud obnoxious never got send bitcoins nigerian prince sister girlfriend,0.046614583333333334,positive,-0.9667,Negative,-0.029,Neutral

2024-12-30 06:16:36,"As Bitcoin appreciates, you’ve got two options. Let’s break it down:  Say you’ve got $100K in Bitcoin as long-term savings. You borrow $10K in cash against it—this puts you at a 10% loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. Now, you owe $10K plus interest at some point in the future.  Fast forward, and Bitcoin’s supply on exchanges dries up (a supply shock), causing the price to skyrocket as nations and companies buy it up. Let’s say Bitcoin hits $1 million. Your $100K of Bitcoin just 10x’d to $1 million. Now you owe $10K, but your collateral is worth $1 million. Your LTV has dropped from 10% to 1%.  At this point, you’ve got two options:  1. **Take another loan:** Borrow against the new collateral value. Instead of $10K, you take out a $100K loan (bringing you back to a 10% LTV) 2. **Sell a small portion:** Sell 1% of your Bitcoin to pay off the $10K loan, use $10K to pay off the old loan, and pocket $90K to use however you want.  Option 1 is what Michael Saylor talks about in the video—it’s the strategy wealthy people use. You keep your Bitcoin intact, borrow against it again when it appreciates, and repeat the process. Let’s say Bitcoin hits $13 million by 2045 (a common projection). You’d continue borrowing, living off the loans, and never selling your Bitcoin—meaning no capital gains tax. You could pay off the loans if you want, but you don’t have to.",appreciates youve got option let break youve got longterm saving borrow cash itthis put loantovalue ltv ratio owe plus interest point future fast forward bitcoins supply exchange dry supply shock causing skyrocket nation company buy let hit million million owe collateral worth million ltv dropped point youve got option another loan borrow collateral instead loan bringing ltv sell small portion sell pay loan pay loan pocket however option michael saylor talk videoits strategy wealthy keep intact borrow appreciates repeat process let hit million common projection youd continue borrowing living loan never selling bitcoinmeaning capital gain tax pay loan,0.05476190476190477,positive,0.9246,Positive,-0.02640845070422535,Neutral

2024-12-30 06:02:47,"I suggested he watch the video because it perfectly explains the strategy used by wealthy families and CEOs to preserve and grow their wealth, and I was driving at the time.  When you sell an asset, you lose its future potential value. Bitcoin is unique because it’s the one asset almost guaranteed to appreciate against the dollar. The dollar’s value is constantly diluted through printing, while Bitcoin's supply is fixed. Borrowing against an appreciating asset like Bitcoin is the ideal scenario. As the asset’s value increases, the loan-to-value ratio naturally decreases, minimizing the impact of the loan over time.  The reality is simple: anyone who has sold Bitcoin in the past wishes they still held it at today’s prices. Soon, it will be the same story, people who sold below $1 million will regret it when we reach that level. Sure, he could sell a portion to play with, but even holding just the 1 Bitcoin out of the total amount, he could've turned that extra $70K that he played with into 10x or more in the future.  This strategy allows you to maintain the full value of your asset indefinitely while borrowing against it to unlock tax-free cash when you need it, as Bitcoin continues to rise. Those who fail to understand this will miss out on the generational wealth they could have preserved.",suggested watch video perfectly explains strategy wealthy family ceo preserve grow wealth driving sell asset lose future potential unique asset almost guaranteed appreciate dollar dollar constantly diluted printing bitcoins supply fixed borrowing appreciating asset ideal scenario asset increase loantovalue ratio naturally decrease minimizing impact loan reality simple anyone sold past wish held today price soon story sold million regret reach level sure sell portion play holding total amount couldve turned extra played future strategy allows maintain full asset indefinitely borrowing unlock taxfree cash continues rise fail understand miss generational wealth preserved,0.1808823529411765,positive,0.986,Positive,0.02910958904109589,Neutral

This is true, the more money you have, the better this strategy will work, because it allows you to keep your loan to value low to get decent cash allotments. Don't lose sight however of how much btc is expected to appreciate against the dollar. We could be looking at a 1 million per btc in 2025/2026 time frame based on supply demand dynamics, not to mention adoption levels. So the average person for the first time has more access to such a strategy that we ever have before, as our modest btc savings are expected to 10x and more in a short amount of time, making this strategy ideal.  >Your strategy outright refuses to even entertain the possibility that Bitcoin's price may drop.  Not true, this is why I talked about small amounts of collateral loans at 10% or less. BTC would have to do a 80% to 90% drop to pose a threat of liquidation. There is too much adoption to see drops that deep anymore, but even if we did see it, it would be bought up incredibly fast by all the nation-state, and corporate players now in the bitcoin game.

After covid occurred, we had a sharp increase in our total cash supply, of up to 42%, causing massive inflation. The money printers haven't stopped printing either.   Bitcoin on the other hand has a fixed supply of 21 million coins. It cannot be inflated like the dollar can be.

2025-07-04 09:21:50,"In 2011, Bitcoin’s circulating supply was around 6–8 million BTC, and 10,000 BTC would’ve represented roughly 0.13–0.17% of it. At that time, such a stack could be acquired through mining, buying on Mt. Gox for \~$7,800, or participating in early dev or darknet activities. It was challenging, but not impossible for early adopters, libertarian techies, or Silk Road players.  Bunch of red flags here - the wallet held exactly 10,000 BTC untouched for 14 years; no test transactions, no movement until now. That kind of cold storage discipline is rare, especially for early adopters who often lost keys, panicked, or partially sold. If NSA created Btc then only they can be so nonchalant.  1. Satoshi or Early Dev Wallet. The exact 10,000 BTC and no movement for 14 years resemble early Satoshi-era behavior. It could belong to Hal Finney, Martti Malmi, or someone directly tied to Bitcoin’s origin. 2. Government Seizure Wallet. The wallet might be linked to a silent government seizure - possibly from Silk Road or BTC-e now being moved quietly to liquidate or fund operations. 3. Nation-State Sleeper Whale. A foreign government or intelligence-linked group may have acquired and held the stash as a strategic reserve, now activated to fund war efforts or financial disruption. 4. Dead Man’s Switch or Timed Unlock. The coins could have been programmed to move automatically after a set time, triggered by inactivity, BTC price targets, or the original owner's death. 5. Ross Ulbriht, doing some housekeeping chores. Silk Road launched in February 2011, but went viral in June after a Gawker article exposed it as a darknet marketplace for drugs. That exposure triggered a surge in users and helped drive BTC’s price from \~$2 to \~$30 over the summer. Said BTC were acquired in April 2011. Could Ross receive first payments in just first 4 months after the launch and total more then $7.8k? Shouldn't be that hard. But hold it through all these years even during imprisonment?  6.

However, there is a real chance that a massive cracking effort has unlocked a few wallets by now.   Why do I believe it?  There's state actors such as N. Korea, Israel, and America and there may be others that have motivation and perhaps the capabilities.   Motivation: Moving billions of dollars in an economy worth a few trillion could easily influence prices and allow market manipulation.    Just showing someone that you control this amount of money could let you borrow against it and get ready access to money and resources that doesn't have to go through, say Congress for example.     Perhaps you can prove to an arms dealer that you are good for the money, put half in one wallet and half in another.  Give them the keys to one wallet and hold the other keys for the other until they deliver your black market warhead, custom e. coli strain, gently used B2 bomber, etc.  Capabilities: That's the thing.  Noone can say with any authority how much computing power any one nation can bring to bear on a problem like this.   Nor can we say what backdoors and workarounds they may have discovered.  All we can actually say is that there are people playing in this sandbox.  We don't know who's a toddler eating catshit and who's the high schooler building award winning sand sculpture.  The Bybit hack is the biggest example the public is aware of yet.   This was a sophisticated attack taking advantage in a vulnerability in the process of a transfer, redirecting the funds to the attacker's wallet.  Details are still coming out on this and money laundering is absolutely still in progress.  Beyond phishing and social engineering attacks, there are a few other theoretical methods publicly known.  That said, these are mostly academic in nature and the only ""effective"" method I have seen cannot be directly targetted.      The thing is, big organizations with secrets to keep could absolutely have capabilities beyond what we may be aware of.  Whose to say the surveillance backdoors in all of our phones aren't collecting your passphrase?

Exchanges still don't touch that coin and he can't change the bitcoin into money. If he finds a person to change with it, that person won't be able to change it into money.
