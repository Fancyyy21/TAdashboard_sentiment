2024-12-05 18:49:48,She really speed ran fame. From basically a nobody to crypto scam. I'm impressed.
2024-12-05 19:01:07,"Did I really just read ""losing life savings after buying her cryptocurrency? How stupid are some people?"
2024-12-05 19:00:46,What moron would put their life savings to buy hawk tuah girl’s cryptocurrency?
2024-12-05 18:57:59,$HAWK walked so $HAWK2 can run
2024-12-05 19:04:11,"The guy on the Twitt says:      ""My $35,000 that I purchased of [$Hawk](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24Hawk) is now $2,000 after 10 minutes of buying. I am a huge fan of Hawk Tuah but you took my life savings. I purchased your coin [$Hawk](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24Hawk) that you were so excited about with my life savings and children’s college education fund as…  Either it's a fake story or this guy deserves it"

2024-12-05 19:04:27,"Honestly, if you bought a crypto called ""Hawk Tuah"", you are the one who should be jailed."
2024-12-05 18:50:12,“So... it turns out the Hawk Tauh crypto meme coin was not a good investment.”   Ya don’t say!
2024-12-05 19:04:16,"Can't wait for coffeezilla to make a video about this, people are so dumb."
2024-12-05 19:03:17,"Imagine being a worker in a spring factory and suddenly a lucrative podcast deal drops into your lap, Netflix buy movie rights from you, and instead of realising how blessed you are and making the best of the amazing opportunity you just pull a crypto rug pull and people want to jail you."
2024-12-05 18:50:49,If you put your life savings in to a blowjob girl cryptocurrency you deserve everything you get.
2024-12-05 19:00:20,some people got hawk tuah'd by the hawk tuah girl and now they're bitching and crying about it? this world is fuckin nuts man
2024-12-05 20:44:39,"What kind of person sees a currency made about a meme of a woman saying something silly about giving a blow job, then thinks ""this will be a serious financial instrument, I will be able to one day walk into a business and spend my internet video blowjob currency in exchange for a nice family meal"""
2024-12-05 19:02:26,Wen lambo?
2024-12-05 18:48:34,Most exchanges have a literal pop up saying not to be extremely cautious on memecoins lol. Yet here they are. Bunch of whackos
2024-12-05 19:05:47,People who bought that coin don't deserve to be in the vicinity of money lmao
2024-12-05 19:03:29,What did people honestly expect... A meme coin about a meme person...  It's ok when they sell to another bag holder for profit... They don't think about that.  The crypto game is based on the next greater fool mentality... Rarely is a practical use value associated with crypto... Esp. meme coins.
2024-12-05 18:56:52,"I actually think she shouldn't. If you're dumb enough to put money (especially your life savings!?!) into shitcoins shilled by an influencer called ""Hawk Tuah Girl"", I think you 100% deserve it at this point."
2024-12-05 19:01:59,So the rug pulling has began!
2024-12-05 18:56:16,Life savings of $5.75. They will never financially recover from this.
2024-12-05 19:10:16,"tldr; Hawk Tuah Girl, also known as Haliey Welch, faced backlash after her cryptocurrency, $HAWK, plummeted in value shortly after its launch, leaving some fans claiming to have lost their life savings. Accusations of a 'rug pull' emerged, suggesting Welch and her team sold off their stock, causing the crash. Welch denied these claims, stating her team hadn't sold any tokens. However, critics, including YouTube investigator Coffeezilla, alleged insider trading and poor launch management. Fans expressed their financial losses, with some claiming significant personal impacts.  *This summary is auto generated by a bot and not meant to replace reading the original article. As always, DYOR."
2024-12-05 19:04:43,"I'm supposed to have sympathy for someone who put their life savings in Hawktua coin.  You have to be a special kind of stupid, lol. wtf"
2024-12-05 19:00:46,"Just jumped on phantom and saw the insane dip. Kind of speaks for itself when it says ""Unverified"" in front of your face lmao"
2024-12-05 19:06:14,Anyone who bought this coin deserves to be scammed.
2024-12-05 18:59:37,How do you even buy this kind of shit?
2024-12-05 19:30:20,Imagine explaining to a 14th century peasant in the afterlife how you managed to lose their whole bloodlines net worth over a fake coin scam and how it ruined your life lmao
2024-12-05 19:02:37,"This is why people dont take crypto seriously. 99% of it is a joke, a scam, a political grift. Besides the teh isuses of security, trust, usage, we have to deal with this shit.   I have zero sympathy for anyone who loses money in crypto. I've lost what would have been hudnreds of millions in todays values in BTC through Cryptsy.   People need to stop clicking shit, stop listening to a fucking moron where to invest, sotp letting their dick pick their crypto, etc."
2024-12-05 18:51:31,"SquidGame2 will also attract a lot of interest, wtf"
2024-12-05 18:54:24,But who will play her in the presumably pending Netflix movie?
2024-12-05 19:08:31,Anyone buying a crack babies shit coin deserve what the got .
2024-12-05 19:20:59,If you bought her cryptocurrency you deserve to lose your money.
2024-12-05 20:26:45,"This is an example of something my opinion has completely flipped on in the last few months. I used to hate people who shilled shitcoins. But then I realized that there is so much fucking money flying around to promote awful products that kill us, and content creators that I actually like accepting a payday to keep making content I like and shill a stupid idea is so low on my list of priorities. At this point the bigger problem is that there are so many people who apparently think cryptocurrency is something other than gambling where the rigging is happening in plain view... and convince their friends and family who don't know better to listen to their stupid investment ideas."
2024-12-05 20:43:16,if youre still buying influencer coins in 2024 then youre an idiot and deserve to be broke... youre putting youre faith in someone who is only famous because she told a camera that she spits on guys cocks before she sucks them off....
2024-12-05 18:54:40,She’ll be talking tuah judge soon
2024-12-05 19:05:38,How degenerated you have to be to put more than 50 bucks into this shit?
2024-12-05 19:06:44,Well that's what happens when you listen to a C tier influencer.
2024-12-05 19:09:06,"I'm fairly confident she has no idea what she's doing and is just saying what she's being told to say. Probably got sold a lie by a grifter team. But even then...I don't understand why these ""famous"" people keep agreeing to jump on the next crypto fad when they have a train wreck of colleagues behind them."
2024-12-05 19:10:05,I’ll buy doge or Pepe coins many times more before I’d buy some influencer rugpull.
2024-12-05 19:12:35,Anybody who invests in cryptocurrency without knowing the risks shouldn't have anybody to blame but themselves. A fool and their money are easily Departed.
2024-12-05 19:17:40,Anyone who gets rugged by the hawk tuah girl deserves it.
2024-12-05 19:18:47,"Bye bye  Btw, you should do your research on the people that fund you. Going balls deep with the Paul brothers was, in fact, not a good choice.   Enjoy all the litigation"
2024-12-05 19:27:38,"I cannot stop laughing at the whole concept here. A girl gets famous for saying like 7 words in a viral video, she markets merch with ""hawk tuah"" on hats, and then she makes a crypto from ""hawk"" and people thought that WASN'T going to be a rug pull? Every single thing she's done since the hit counter went nuclear is grab as much cash as possible. It was always going to be a rug pull! You knew it was going to be a rug pull when you bought it! What possible financial infrastructure could there possibly be behind ""Spit on that thang!"" She's not hosting Ted Talks on financial literacy. She's Hawk Tuah!"
2024-12-05 19:59:23,Dude fuck this girl. I cannot stand hearing about her anymore. She’s famous for talking about giving head come on
2024-12-05 20:23:51,canada bill jones always said it was immoral to let a sucker keep his money
2024-12-05 21:05:28,"So, you took investment advice from a person who's only claim to fame was a hot take advice blurb on sucking cock and you're all surprised Pikachu when the investment didn't pan out?   What, was Lana Rhodes just a hair too sketchy for your financial guidance?   This post-Harambe idiocracy world is too much sometimes."
2024-12-05 19:05:08,Let this be a reminder to all that altcoins are simply a social experiment to see who can get lucky selling during the pump but realistically they become victims of the dump 
2024-12-05 18:53:28,"there are thousands of examples of this very thing happening, probably even millions of examples. in a space where it's fear or fomo, DYOR."
2024-12-05 19:02:19,What a world - made instantly famous for hawk tuah and pookie and instantly wiped out by crypto.
2024-12-05 19:06:00,I can guarantee you this chick has no idea what a rug pull is (or she thinks it's a sex thing) or how to carry it out.
2024-12-05 19:04:58,"Obviously there is no legal basis to jail her for anything lol. She didn't create the coin, ect, ect.  But its hard to even blame the people making these rugpulls when people so willingly swap their $ for it"
2024-12-05 19:11:14,It is ur fault if u bought this coin and im glad that happened to u. U should’ve seen this from miles away
2024-12-05 19:24:15,she talked about spitting on a dick and got “famous” for it. what kind of fucked up simulation are we living in?
2024-12-05 19:31:24,She should have done an #OF atleast she would have only been taking simps money.
2024-12-05 19:32:05,"There’s no way someone put their life savings in this shit. Everyone who lost money here was just trying to time the market and syphon money from a greater fool, which turned out to be themselves."
2024-12-05 19:37:52,She ll be subject of studies in the future. She crystallises everything about the modern snake oil merchant game.
2024-12-05 19:38:22,"I will not weep for the people who fell for this scam. At this point if you don't understand that *all* memecoins are shitcoins and are all scams, then that is on you. It was one thing a decade ago when crypto was first exploding. But every memecoin since then has been a scam.  how many times are you going to let Lucy pull the football out from under you like Charlie Brown before you stop falling for it?  But also, something should be done about these crypto pump and dump schemes. But that will never happen"
2024-12-05 19:41:11,"It pisses me off how easy it is to not only create a coin but how easy it is to swindle people out of millions. Every little life event that happens moving forward, I’m making a coin for it"
2024-12-05 20:01:42,Someone needs to make a moron coin
2024-12-05 20:17:11,People are shocked that the hawk tuah meme coin is a disaster? Every time I think the general public can't get any dumber they just keep surprising me.
2024-12-05 20:32:11,This genius grew his account from thousand to 1.4 million in a year. He swapped it for her coin. Cut tom30 minutes later and he sells out for 46k. 1.35 million loss in 30 minutes. Lol
2024-12-05 20:32:21,"There are literally no celebrity coins in existence that haven't been rugged, so I don't feel sorry for the stupid people who invested ""their life savings"" into this obvious scam."
2024-12-05 20:35:12,"""A fool and his money are lucky to even get together in the first place"" -Gordon Gekko, *Wall Street*, 1987."
2024-12-05 20:40:01,"So far it seems like they charged like a 17% fee for people to buy the coin, there was no lockup, so the owners just sold the coins from the fees they generated right away. Add in the normal bots that buy and sell right away and you have the makings of a predictable outcome. It's like blaming the casino because you lost 14 hands at blackjack."
2024-12-05 21:31:03,The new American dream…achieve your 15 mins of fame off of a viral video and turn it into a horrible podcast and a crypto rug pull
2024-12-05 22:10:32,…you guys thought that twitter post was real?
2024-12-05 23:23:10,"I, for one, believe we should all take financial advice from a girl who is famous for saying you should spit on weiners. Nothing could go wrong. Surely."
2024-12-05 23:24:46,"If you buy Hawk Tua crypto, you kinda had it coming."
2024-12-05 23:31:17,I’m investing my life savings into the dick sucking girl currency. What a time to be alive. Natural selection isn’t working
2024-12-05 23:59:42,This just might be the most American thing I've ever seen.  Should replace the bald eagle with her.
2024-12-06 06:35:47,"She made herself famous with the ""Hawk-Tuah"" then made a meme coin so you would ""flok-tuah"" , then, when you all got fucked with no ""Hawk-Tuah"" ,  yall are seriously ""Shocked-Tuah""    seems legit"
2024-12-06 09:48:12,"Sorry, but if you put your life savings into Hawl Tuah shitcoin that's kinda on you."
2024-12-06 11:42:28,Imagine putting your life savings into a hawk tuah coin
2024-12-06 11:58:05,"This is the funniest news all year. Who in the everlasting fuck invests his life savings into ""Hawk Tuah! Spit on that thang!""-cryptocurrency?!"
2024-12-06 13:34:19,If you were stupid enough to throw your life saving by investing in a girl who's claim to fame was faux spitting on a dick then... You kind of deserve to lose it. It's not like she was famous for giving investment tips and tricks. So anyways would you like to buy some magic beans??
2024-12-07 00:02:59,I suspect she is just the fall woman. Someone in the background screwed everyone over
2024-12-07 02:24:20,"Dude you guys think she even knows what’s going on? She’s just the face of it, the branding. Who tf would dump so much money into such a ridiculous coin. These idiots deserve to lose money."
2024-12-05 19:14:31,I dont feel bad for anyone who gets rugged on crypto in 2024.  Good for her.
2024-12-05 18:48:44,HAHAHHAHHAHA
2024-12-05 18:50:14,"""life savings"" yeah I'm sure that $25 bucks you blew is killing ya."
2024-12-05 19:08:28,"She is under Jake Paul's company Betr right? There is also the possibility she is being used as pawn. Sad reality, but things like this does happen especially when you become famous overnight."
2024-12-05 19:11:04,The country had jumped the shark.  Imagine explaining this story to someone in 1955.
2024-12-05 19:16:44,"And I thought the ""spit on cock before you suck it"" girl had some inside knowledge or wisdom on investing....said no one ever."
2024-12-05 20:45:28,"If you bought this, you don't deserve to have money."
2024-12-05 18:48:23,We should stop making st*pid people (and currencies) famous.
2024-12-05 18:52:56,they deserve it.  but i guess she still deserves jail too.  you gotta be a fucking pathetic simp to fall for that shit.  fuck you pathetic fucking simps.  you fucking deserve that shit!

2024-12-05 19:10:37,How stupid are people? Hawk Tuah? Who is this person?
2024-12-05 19:16:09,Did she really made that hawktuak crypto or someone else did and she got blamed?
2024-12-05 19:16:21,They deserve her just like she deserves them
2024-12-05 19:16:50,Hell if you were stupid enough to buy her crypto.. thats on you.
2024-12-05 19:18:23,"Why do we even care about people like this? She was a nobody, let her be a nobody. Don’t give people you hard earned money when they haven’t earned hard earned money!"
2024-12-05 19:18:54,If you put your life savings buying into this then maybe it’s a life lesson you need to learn.
2024-12-05 19:18:57,"If you choose to jump off a cliff, don’t blame the cliff"
2024-12-05 19:19:29,This situation kinda reminds me of the video where the woman calls the cops cos she was trying to buy crack and got ripped off. If you fall for a scam like this I think you kinda deserve it. Who gambles their life savings on shit coins?
2024-12-05 19:19:32,Maybe this will be in the spotlight enough to bring more regulation/criminal charges against these thieves.
2024-12-05 19:19:49,What do you expect from someone who is famous for spitting on it lol
2024-12-05 19:20:20,Dumbest….timeline…..EVER!!
2024-12-05 19:20:28,Did she herself launch the coin or somebody else did. Why did the coin crash immediately.
2024-12-05 19:20:44,I'd be surprised if this girl knew how to create an erc20 token
2024-12-05 19:21:12,Logan paul could learn from her
2024-12-05 19:21:42,Spit on that thang to make the money back

2024-12-05 19:32:43,Buy the dip guys!
2024-12-05 19:34:27,Why can't people like her just get the bag and walk away? She was a normal person before all of this and I'm assuming has made a ton of money off of a short random video. If I'm her I take the money and live my life.
2024-12-05 19:39:47,I like how this girl not that long ago didn’t have a pot to piss in and is now rich and greedy enough to start her own bullshit crypto. Whoever lost money on this deserves it.
2024-12-05 19:40:07,She didn't sell bath water first? Amateur ..
2024-12-05 19:41:34,"“I bought 35,000 worth!!” Well that’s dumb, also what on earth would leave you to believe it would increase in value?"

2024-12-05 19:45:42,You were idiots for buying it.
2024-12-05 19:46:28,"Going to be honest here: I don’t know if I blame her entirely. She went from being a nobody from the middle of Tennessee with no social media and no crypto experience at all to being extremely famous and having people approach her saying she can make millions. I find it really hard to believe she could have understood what she was getting into. And if she did, she should 100% play dumb to try and avoid jail lol. I just find the team that used her way more problematic."

2024-12-05 20:03:39,Maybe don't dump your life savings in the dick sucking crypto coin you didnt research.
2024-12-05 20:04:50,Seriously. If you spend your life savings buying anything from the hawk tuah girl you deserve everything that happens to you.

2024-12-05 20:44:38,I believe you don’t deserve to be in charge of your own money if you are still buying shit coin in this day and age
2024-12-05 20:45:02,"Not only should crypto rug pulls be legal and okay to do, they should be encouraged. Maybe then people will stop 'investing' in garbage. People who lost money on this are basically no different than a gambler betting all their money on a single number in roulette."

A rug pull is when the liquidity is pulled, not when others got out before you did.

2024-12-05 23:36:57,Whats worse? Losing life savings or believing that some rando that made a blowjob reference on tik tok’s crypto scheme would be a wise investment?  How does this all work anyway? I havenpeople constantly begging me to get Doge and Peppi and all these others but what causes them to rise and fall? Is it kinda a pyramid deal where the more people you get to buy the more money you get?

The SEC case against Ripple would have gone a long way to establishing what are the listing requirements for a coin/token and whether an exchange can trade them.   IMHO, We are taking a step backwards with crypto not being defined or having a legal definition which can be regulated. Memcoins should be considered like baseball cards or comics or NFT.  Crypto should have some basic listing requirements (commodity or security) and exchanges should be better defined themselves and what they can exchange and how they do it.   Right now, it is a Wild West, any one can open a casino with any rules.  It slows down adoption. Regulatory clarity will help the entire spectrum of crypto."

But this comes with a lot of potential pitfalls if you don’t have the right people around you. She’s young and I’m sure those around her are just as young. I’m certain someone got her and and filled her head with this dumb idea to leverage the fame into the coin while not understanding a damn thing about crypto or the people that were pushing her to do this. This is sure to end whatever fame and good grace she found with the public.

Thousands of posts every day of stories just like this and they don’t learn anything from it. They turn around and do it again next week and lose it all again.
2024-12-05 20:05:34,„I purchased your coin $Hawk that you were so excited about with my life savings and children’s college education fund as well.“  Wow.
2024-12-05 20:05:52,How I know the top is near.
2024-12-05 20:06:10,"She ""hawk tuahed"" right in everyone's face this time.....and took all their money."
2024-12-05 20:06:34,When did it become someone else's fault when you make a bad investment?
2024-12-05 20:06:42,Investing life savings 😂
2024-12-05 20:06:49,Okay but we all know this is 100% fabricated right? The whole thing. It has nothing to do with crypto. This was simply to get us to talk about this bitch.    Say what you want about her. But she's got a dope marketing team.
2024-12-05 20:06:57,Who df is stupid enough to invest in a coin like this? What did they expect?
2024-12-05 20:07:09,Why do people keep falling for influencer / celebrity crypto scams 🤣
2024-12-05 20:07:09,"There is a certain level of trust that celebrities build with their audience. So even a fairly cautious person might decide to go all in on something like this. After all, their beloved celeb wouldn't possibly be doing something so atrocious to their fans, right?      And that's accounting for the difference between celeb coins launched by the actual celeb (rare) and those launched by a totally unrelated person.      So here we got a coin launched by the actual celeb, trusted and followed by millions. Couldn't possibly rug, right? Like, she'd ruin her reputation, right?   And then they do.   Iggy Azalea was one of the biggest stars to actually launch a token that then rugged. And she's still here. No punishment. No jail. Until there are actual legal consequences for proven rug pulls, this will continue.      For the OGs, remember the ICO craze way back then? Same thing, Paris Hilton and other B and C level celebs would launch a coin and rug. This is the same thing just easier for non-crypto folk to fall victim to."
2024-12-05 20:07:12,"Good! I hope every moron that bought into this obvious scam loses everything. I’m so tired of these fucking influencers, but the incel cucks who follow bitches like this deserve every single thing they get."
2024-12-05 20:07:33,Keep buying. It will come back. Hawk tuah!
2024-12-05 20:07:35,"If you invested in this or really any celebrity meme coin, you should expect to lose money."
2024-12-05 20:07:54,Can someone ELI5 how the rug pull worked?
2024-12-05 20:08:00,All is forgiven. Give me the Hawk Tuah!
2024-12-05 20:09:05,Guys I gambled at a casino and lost?!
2024-12-05 20:09:43,"It’s ultimately up to your choice if you invest in crypto , stocks or any investment. Investing solely because you like someone or someone tells you to into something you have no idea about is your fault. I don’t stand with crypto scams but this is not the first. There are so many crypto scams and stock market scams daily that If you hold one you should hold all accountable. She should at least be fined or sued to repay the money . Calling for jail time is ridiculous."
2024-12-05 20:09:52,"Whatever the complainers' hot takes are, she didn't take anything from them. They do it themselves.     It's like throwing cash down a pit fire with a sign that says ""gimme your money"", and then cursing at it, ""you took it, why you took it from me?""     Like, I get it if we still try to invest in BTC or whatever (I did in the past), but to throw money at a shit coin with no technical merit or financial backing?   Why? Did they expect her to hawk-twak them as a quarterly dividend or something?"
2024-12-05 20:10:42,"Next up, man tries to sue casino for losing all his money playing blackjack 😹💰"
2024-12-05 20:11:08,TIL Hawk Tuah girl had a cryptocurrency

2024-12-05 20:12:22,Why no demands that her fans be more educated or at least utilize common sense?
2024-12-05 20:12:28,Life savings. lol
2024-12-05 20:12:31,"Even though i don't think she should go to jail, it would be hilarious if she did. One day your unknown, then the hawk tuah girl, then a criminal behind bars lol. Im sure she's sick of the fame now haha"
2024-12-05 20:13:51,Netflix were on crack when they offered literally anything to her holy shit.
2024-12-05 20:14:04,A fool and his money will soon be parted. How do some fools have a lot of money to begin with?
2024-12-05 20:14:09,"Reading news like these makes me think that some people just deserve to be scammed, lmao. I can't believe how stupid you have to be to buy into this. Ffs she operates under Logan Paul's company."
2024-12-05 20:14:18,Don't put in what you can't afford to lose
2024-12-05 20:15:31,C'mon ! At this point of time and people still falling for shitcoins? LoL hard losses make the best lessons
2024-12-05 20:17:33,From hawk tuah to rug puah
2024-12-05 20:18:00,So you gamble your child's education fund on a dick sucking sinner and then you are disappointed how amazing that is.
2024-12-05 20:18:09,"jail the morons who bought it , as well as anyone who owns BTC"
2024-12-05 20:18:23,Wait. Your made at someone else based off a girl that became famous by joking about giving a blowjob with spit. Grow up. This person is new to the game will be a puppet to people willing to push ideas.
2024-12-05 20:18:35,hawk tuah? more like hawk toe.   she looks like a toe from certain angles
2024-12-05 20:19:02,"Gambling and crying about lost money? Sounds like every single person ""investing"" into cryptos..."
2024-12-05 20:20:02,Hawk tuah did nothing wrong.. at least nothing every other crypto pumper isn’t doing.
2024-12-05 20:23:37,Whatever money she made now she just fades away in obscurity then profit
2024-12-05 20:26:14,Wow! She really unscrubs down!
2024-12-05 20:27:16,How much did she rug for
2024-12-05 20:28:34,"LMAO, a moron is separated from his $, a tale as old as time"
2024-12-05 20:29:05,"""A fool and his money are soon parted""  It's a hustle baby, suck it up!!  She did not put a gun to your head and made you do it!  You done the deed, FAFO#"
2024-12-05 20:29:25,What a bunch of dumb dumbs
2024-12-05 20:32:04,I’m shocked -SHOCKED!- to find that there is gambling happening in this establishment!  (Your winnings sir)
2024-12-05 20:32:09,The Pauls are being sued for their own crypto scam (amongst a smorgasbord of other scams) and are the ones behind her podcast and capitalizing on her meme sensationalism.   Why would anyone think this would be any different? Why would anyone invest in a one hit wonder with zero experience or knowledge in crypto? Why would anyone risk any amount of money on Blowjob Girl? WHY?!
2024-12-05 20:33:07,Isnt this what Boogie2988 did?
2024-12-05 20:34:42,Nice
2024-12-05 20:34:54,This is prob fake to keep her fame flame going
2024-12-05 20:35:33,ROFLMFAO!!!   I guess they should have spit on that thang.
2024-12-05 20:35:49,She a Paul bro cronie… they’re all scumbags who run with one another.
2024-12-05 20:36:42,"This is what happens when you let Jack Paul be your mentor, haha"
2024-12-05 20:36:51,Is there any shit coins that even have a reason to buy?   You might as well buy some 3x leverage options and hope... at least a win there would net some huge gains
2024-12-05 20:37:29,"Regardless if the people losing money are dumb, the fact that scams like this happen is a huge detriment to the crypto community as a whole and should be illegal. A Ponzi scheme is a Ponzi scheme and they’re illegal for a reason. This chick should be in jail because that’s what is supposed to happen to scammers that try to fuck over people."
2024-12-05 20:37:45,spitting on that thang...howed it work for ya!
2024-12-05 20:39:14,She will have to thawk Tu ah judge about this. Love it. 😂
2024-12-05 20:39:29,Did she actually make statements that suggests guaranteed returns?
2024-12-05 20:40:55,Why is it illegal what she did technically. Is it fraudulent. Misinformation???
2024-12-05 20:41:29,Why would anyone do that?
2024-12-05 20:41:31,"Like her or not, this is a pretty black and white case of a pump and dump scam.   She's hosed.   Probably didn't even know what she was doing was illegal."
2024-12-05 20:42:23,"She is a plant. Think about it...after her, not even her video goes viral, shes on Bill Maher like 2 weeks later? Not buying it, or her ""crypto""...any my motto is buy everything. Rather buy more crob than whatever shes shilling, and im not buying more crob"
2024-12-05 20:42:39,They deserved to be hawk tuah’ed
2024-12-05 20:42:58,Everybody that lost money on this are degenerate scammers themselves and only upset bc they mistimed it and ended up being the mark
2024-12-05 20:43:06,"""Haley is lying and will likely have to tuak tua judge"". Brilliant."
2024-12-05 20:43:30,"Are we supposed to feel sorry for the ""victims""?"
2024-12-05 20:44:48,"Y'all are wild, clearly time to buy the dip."

2024-12-05 20:49:26,Who'd have thought a blowjob backed currency would only last 5 minutes?
2024-12-05 20:50:04,What did he expect? After the Hawk Tuah.... she goes down...
2024-12-05 20:52:22,Never underestimate the stupidity of the masses
2024-12-05 20:52:22,People could have spent the same money investing in a dog
2024-12-05 20:52:29,Shoulda been call SpitCoin. Missed a goldmine there
2024-12-05 20:53:29,"she’s famous for spitting on dicks, what were they thinking? Lmao"
2024-12-05 20:53:41,Excuse me while I HAWK TUAH myself
2024-12-05 20:53:51,"Wait, there's people in this sub with savings?"
2024-12-05 20:53:58,"There is absolutely no way someone put their life savings into this. If they did, that money was going to disappear sooner than later anyway."
2024-12-05 20:54:04,Financial darwinism
2024-12-05 20:54:51,It's those dastardly devs who done him dirty
2024-12-05 20:54:53,"It's obviously not nice to get rug pulled. But I feel if you get done by buying into a coin shilled by a fairly recent minor online celeb, then it's kinda your own fault."
2024-12-05 20:58:31,Who in their right mind would dump their life savings into a coin being shilled by the Hawk Tuah girl. I didn't even know about it till after the rug had been pulled
2024-12-05 20:58:33,"I'm looking forward to coffeezilla covering this, and it coming back to the paul brothers"

2024-12-05 21:02:07,this timeline is so fucking stupid
2024-12-05 21:02:32,if you lost everything investing in the girl famous for fellatio because she was giving finance a go and you went all in with your life savings... you took a huge risk and there was obviously almost zero chance of it paying off.  I have no sympathy.
2024-12-05 21:05:47,I wonder if any of the people who got over excited and tanked had also once bought some chicks bath water.
2024-12-05 21:06:07,"Glad that Coffeezilla is investigating it too. Hopefully he make a video and expose their scum asses   >During the live stream YouTube investigator Stephen 'Coffeezilla' joined and gave the viral sensation a bit of a grilling.  >He said: “This is one of the most miserable, horrible launches I’ve ever seen. I’ve been tracing it on the chain for a while. You guys generated over a million dollars in fees, while your fans got rug pulled. There were snipers, but there was also insider trading directly linked to y’all’s creator accounts.”"
2024-12-05 21:06:51,The US has endless consumer protection laws preventing regular companies from doing this idk why people act like crypto is exempt. 
2024-12-05 21:07:07,I mean.. it’s kinda their own fault?
2024-12-05 21:07:16,The chart went to 200 mil marketcap in the first 2 seconds of launch. If you can’t grasp that a 200 million 1s candle wick is a scam then you deserve to get rugged.
2024-12-05 21:07:29,Honestly anyone buying that much of Hawk Tuah's crypto currency deserve every bit of financial ruin coming their way. Really? You thought that was the one?   It's just natural selection doing it's thing.
2024-12-05 21:07:45,"Everyone’s life, including hers would have been better if she never Hawk-Tuahd…"

2024-12-05 21:13:39,So…dead cat bounce?
2024-12-05 21:13:56,What do they want her to do?  Spit on it?
2024-12-05 21:15:13,"Nope. Not defending the bitch, but if you put your life-savings into a meme coin, that's on your stupid ass, not her."
2024-12-05 21:15:19,If you’re watching her show you have serious issues. I have never seen a person more articulate elevated by society than this person. It’s insane.
2024-12-05 21:15:48,What a shit hole website   So what did she say?
2024-12-05 21:15:58,"This is not financial advice, please consult a professional if needed, just my opinion:   Put your life savings anywhere else besides BJ quote meme girl coin.   Leave it downtown with a note that says ""plz no take.""    Send it to the Indian scammer of your choice.   Buy shares in United Health.   Feed it to a lion.   These are all more viable options."
2024-12-05 21:16:13,>I purchased your coin $Hawk that you were so excited about with my life savings and children’s college education fund as well.  I hate to be like this but you literally put your savings into the most volatile thing possible
2024-12-05 21:17:08,So….buy the dip?
2024-12-05 21:18:14,“I’m a big fan of hawk tuah” cried the now broke imbecile unaware of the fact that he just admitted to being a fan of someone who literally said one funny thing one time.  This should happen more. Let’s consider it modern Darwinism.
2024-12-05 21:18:29,she had a good run. why in the world would she go into crypto like that? she could just chill for the rest of her life
2024-12-05 21:19:13,I bought some and sold when I was up $1 😎

2024-12-05 21:25:23,They should “Hawk tuah” the cryptocurrency first.
2024-12-05 21:25:23,good luck getting them all...sam pepper and Ice left USA and never got caught
2024-12-05 21:25:54,Who was the asshole that set up her crypto? That's the shit stain that needs to be investigated.

2024-12-05 21:32:42,"I listened to the spaces she hosted and the follow-up spaces hosted by Coffeezilla. She comes across as not very knowledgeable, and her co-host and one of the guys behind her coin was very aggressive, they wouldn't let Coffeezilla speak. In Coffeezilla's follow-up spaces a dev came on and revealed they were offered to work with the same guy behind the HAWK coin but the dev refused when they found out the guy was suspected of rugging two nft projects on Solana. I think Hailey and her fans were all rugged, but unfortunately for her, her name is all over the project."
2024-12-05 21:33:58,You said Rhawg Pullah?
2024-12-05 21:34:47,If your buying crypto endorsed by a celebrity like that then maybe that money wasn't gonna be around long anyways lol.
2024-12-05 21:35:29,No one mentioning the Paul brothers at all who basically created her and blew her up?
2024-12-05 21:36:30,"At the end of the day, when you do business with scammers, expect to get scammed. Nothing new here."
2024-12-05 21:36:30,Who in the fuck bought this coin. Who used their entire savings 😂
2024-12-05 21:36:43,"How much did Hawk Tuah herself make off the crypto rug pull, approximately?"
2024-12-05 21:36:59,Why people are mad? She literally hawked and tuahed
2024-12-05 21:38:21,"yeah, i doubt it. anyone with even resembling something like a brain doesn't take their life savings and think OMG! i'm going to listen to that girl that got famous for talking about sucking dick and buy her crypto.

2024-12-05 21:41:59,"Yeah, this is the top. I'm out"
2024-12-05 21:43:01,Whoever decided to invest on her deserves it
2024-12-05 21:43:07,While the people buying are stupid I do believe every one of these individuals creating false coins and pulling the rug out should be prosecuted.   They are doing a terrific job helping the media push cryptocurrency as a get  rich quick scheme with no real world application as well.

2024-12-05 21:44:40,You cannot blame her for your stupidity.
2024-12-05 21:45:42,Drunk girl on the street tells a stranger and a camera that she believes strongly in aggressively spitting on genitalia before performing oral sex. Not long after she introduces you to her own cryptocurrency and you decide to invest your life savings!?   Sometimes you get what you deserve.
2024-12-05 21:47:53,This line in the article got me:  “Haliey is lying and will likely have to “talk tuah” judge about this.”
2024-12-05 21:49:06,You’re telling me a crack baby that said she spits on penises while she was drunk on the street is not a great person to invest in?   At least she’s making America great again

2024-12-05 21:51:32,Crypto is a Giant Ponzi scheme.    The secret is to sell it before it bottoms out.   Doge coin should have taught people a lesson
2024-12-05 21:51:35,Sorry but how can you feel bad for these people falling for this at this point?

2024-12-05 21:55:41,are meme coins over yet?  getting sick of these stupid distractions.
2024-12-05 21:55:56,If you lose your savings in this fucking crap you are a dumb fucking moron and you deserve it. You shouldn’t be allowed to manage any amount of money at all if you are dumb enough to gamble it in this

2024-12-05 21:58:02,"Who in their right mind would buy this, let alone spend their life savings on it."
2024-12-05 21:58:44,TRUMPDOGE
2024-12-05 21:58:52,"Crypto people didn't go anywhere near this and are memeing about it. But that means her fans, which I imagine are stupid enough, are the ones she took money from."
2024-12-05 21:58:54,If you dumb enough to drop your life savings on it then you probably would have lost money anyway. Take responsibility
2024-12-05 21:59:18,"You give her your life savings because she gives her boyfriend blowjobs? Guess what , you also got fucked."
2024-12-05 21:59:51,they didnt deserve their money
2024-12-05 21:59:52,"Honestly, suit yourself. You invest your life savings in a crypto coin started by a girl who worked in a factory just one month ago, who became famous for her looks, has a failed app and failed podcast, and refuses to acknowledge the youtuber who made her famous. Just buy lotteries next time."
2024-12-05 22:00:14,"If you put your life savings in a shit coin, you deserve to lose your life savings. Especially from a walking meme."
2024-12-05 22:01:24,Imagine betting your life life savings on a meme.
2024-12-05 22:02:10,People really need to stop buying you meme coins. I don't get it

2024-12-05 22:11:02,Almost like crypto is one big grift.
2024-12-05 22:11:48,Yea she probably didn’t sell any of the coins she bought… WITH HER MAIN WALLET… probably pumped and dumped like crazy with side wallets
2024-12-05 22:13:05,"If you trust your money with a girl famous for her blowjobs, you deserve it, sorry"
2024-12-05 22:14:45,If you aren’t making money off crypto. It’s not for you.
2024-12-05 22:17:38,Sign this Petition to prosecute Haliey welch for crypto scam!      https://chng.it/mnjfRb8Wvx
2024-12-05 22:17:45,I love this.
2024-12-05 22:17:57,Throwing your life savings into a meme crypto launch of a girl who's fame comes from viral video.   Oh boy 
2024-12-05 22:18:04,That’s crypto for yall
2024-12-05 22:18:08,"People are so stupid. If it’s your life savings, why risk it on a shitcoin? People make bad decisions and want to outsource the responsibility for it.    Apart from that, it is important to say that digital influencers are also a cancer on society."
2024-12-05 22:18:26,I can sense a Netflix movie
2024-12-05 22:19:01,"""I'm just having fun."""
2024-12-05 22:19:37,Her PR team are really struggling with this one.   In an interview with Coffeezilla they had to mute him because he was taking them to town and all they could do was deflect with marketing speak (poorly).  Absolute shit show.
2024-12-05 22:21:00,Wow a people doing crypto scams as soon as they get big? Who would have known?
2024-12-05 22:21:04,Future of finance right here folks
2024-12-05 22:21:22,"Sorry to post this on the crypto sub, but 99% of any crypto projects are pump and dump scams. How many times do we have to see it? The best crypto is fucking useless to most of the population of the earth, and those are the “successful” ones.   The guy who lost $33k in 10 minutes, that guy is way closer to anyone who follows this sub that the average person. Look at your reflection and weep."
2024-12-05 22:22:16,Nobody deserves to be scammed but if you invested in this bs that’s a life lesson.
2024-12-05 22:22:56,I don’t understand how it could go from 430 million to 41 million… like why is it worth anything?
2024-12-05 22:23:54,"Crypto currency has no safeguards and you can’t legislate against stupidity. Or perhaps it was just greed. As Dirty Harry said, a man’s gotta know his limitations"
2024-12-05 22:24:18,People's idiocy never ceases to answer me.
2024-12-05 22:24:23,If you lost money in this you are a complete moron. No sympathy.
2024-12-05 22:24:31,Didn't read the article. Did she personally release this memecoin or did others launch this rug pull using her catchphrase?
2024-12-05 22:24:46,People have short memory about crypto and nft scams
2024-12-05 22:24:49,So is this the dip?  Should I buy now?
2024-12-05 22:25:09,"If you fell for a scam from the hawk tuah girl and lost all your money, you 100% deserved it. Also, you should go to jail too on top of that"
2024-12-05 22:25:25,"While this is hilarious and everyone shoulda saw that coming, it was a pretty shit thing to do. Really squeezing every dollar out of that 15 mins, even at the expense of sullying her name. Rug pulls are incredibly slimy, I hope people don't think she's cool for doing this"
2024-12-05 22:25:44,Y'all listened to someone whose only call to fame is spitting on an imaginary cock lol
2024-12-05 22:26:57,If you’re dumb enough to fall for her crypto. Maybe you deserve to be scammed lol that’s on them
2024-12-05 22:27:08,"Blaming her for your stupid decisions is so lame. Do you blame all the actors in the commercials for defective products? If you get sick from eating an m&m, are you gonna blame the ""red m&m"" candy-girl cartoon? Man up!"
2024-12-05 22:27:11,"Hot take:  If you’re taking financial advice from Hawk Tuah, you deserve the consequences of your actions."
2024-12-05 22:27:14,It's a mystery why anyone thought this had any value in the first place
2024-12-05 22:27:25,Make better finacial decisions. All i have to say.
2024-12-05 22:27:29,"This is not a meme coin. It is a security. Stop calling it a meme coin to give these celebs a free pass for breaking the law. If it is issued by a centralized team and the value accrual comes betting on the celeb working for her bag, it is a security by the Howey Test."
2024-12-05 22:28:15,I mean if you’re dumb enough to 1) follow her and 2) buy a crypto from her…you might deserve it
2024-12-05 22:28:24,"Womp womp    I can't fathom how exceptionally dumb you have to be, to put any money into this.    This girl only said ""hawk tuah"" and y'all throw your hard earned money at her. Stop making stupid people famous. Idiocracy really was a documentary"
2024-12-05 22:29:57,"Wow, she has reached insurance company CEO status awfully quick."
2024-12-05 22:29:57,It astonishes me that people still fall prey to these memecoin scams
2024-12-05 22:31:00,"If anybody is dumb enough to put their whole life savings into any one investment, I don’t feel bad about them losing, but even more so if it was in this trash."
2024-12-05 22:31:21,I dont get how anyone can still be surprised this happens; this is *literally* the only use for crypto.
2024-12-05 22:31:30,"“I don’t wanna go to jail, I’d spit on that thang”"
2024-12-05 22:31:39,People bought Hawk Tuah coin? They deserve it.
2024-12-05 22:32:02,My question is:  What made people think that a young girl whose only claim to fame was that she spouted off about horking a loogie on a guys cock; would somehow be a crypto investment savant.
2024-12-05 22:33:00,No sympathy. There are a lot of stuoid people out there.
2024-12-05 22:33:15,"🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 lesson learned, but probably not."
2024-12-05 22:34:13,!register
2024-12-05 22:34:26,What is the sound of one losing one’s life savings on a scam cryptocoin in two seconds?  HOCCCK CHEWA!
2024-12-05 22:35:07,Honestly feel bad for her that she got roped into being associated with this.  She seems like a wholesome girl that just randomly got shoved into this strange celebrity status.
2024-12-05 22:35:14,"Not that I support this behavior, but honestly anyone who buys coins from celebrities deserves what they get. If they are losing their money to hawk tua girl, then they are most likely going to lose their money somewhere else stupid. "
2024-12-05 22:36:47,"""I'm upset because I put all my money into a random meme coin.""  Holy fuck, our society is cooked."
2024-12-05 22:37:10,I remember the last time I saw a young lady on the internet make a blow job joke and I become so enamored with her that I thought burning thousands of dollars I didn't have on a currency that has no value.     Just the other day....
2024-12-05 22:37:11,"If you lost your life savings to this, there is a 100% chance you would have lost it anyway to something just as stupid."
2024-12-05 22:37:36,"She's an idiot, and so many people worship her.  How about now?"
2024-12-05 22:37:43,"I mean, they made the choice? I don't care for her at all but to blame her for something they chose to do?"
2024-12-05 22:37:46,Another influencer rugs their coin. No way did I have that at the end of my 2024 bingo card /s
2024-12-05 22:38:02,Well she is Jewish
2024-12-05 22:38:29,We do not care.
2024-12-05 22:38:45,Why the hell would anybody wants to invest with her without doing some sort of due diligence?
2024-12-05 22:38:46,Why would anyone take financial advice from someone whose claim to fame is coming up with a catch phrase for spitting on a dick?
2024-12-05 22:40:16,Girl boss
2024-12-05 22:40:24,"If you’re dumb enough to buy a celebrity’s Cyrpto coin, you deserve to lose money.   Sorry not sorry. What smooth brained person invests into a celebrities fake currency coin…?  Be more responsible with your money and don’t invest into celebrities. "
2024-12-05 22:40:27,They need to do a case study on people who invested their “life savings” into $HAWK
2024-12-05 22:40:39,"If someone is dumb enough to dump their life savings in a hauk tush crypto, they should be jailed for weapons-grade stupidity."
2024-12-05 22:41:24,Send her to jail
2024-12-05 22:41:36,All I have to say to the people who lost their money is . . . Haha!!
2024-12-05 22:42:03,Knew I shoulda shorted that sht
2024-12-05 22:42:20,Cant blame her when people willing made the choice to get in line to buy her ‘scam’
2024-12-05 22:43:00,Absolutely ridiculous to think this type of investment would be worth anything.
2024-12-05 22:43:08,"I mean... ya, you're probably right...  it's hard to have sympathy for morons though, they would probably donate to their demise anyways."
2024-12-05 22:43:17,She’s on the path to rich and famous. Say stupid stuff and go viral for it then find a way to rip off people below you. The next quickest step these days would seem to be to sell 5G blockers and get on putins payroll then start buying up single family homes in vast qtys.
2024-12-05 22:43:38,So people decided to take financial advice from a girl who’s only claim to fame is simulating oral sex on camera. I think natural selection is working like it’s supposed to.
2024-12-05 22:44:02,"No one put their life savings into this. I also love how the anti government, anti regulation, free market people immediately ran to the authorities after they got rugged.   Idiots."
2024-12-05 22:44:10,Jfc she is repulsive
2024-12-05 22:44:51,She should get the CEO treatment
2024-12-05 22:45:53,Fools and their money.
2024-12-05 22:46:38,if crypto scammers went to jail then there would be precedent to send all billionaires to jail so i doubt it.
2024-12-05 22:46:41,"So they got fucked. From her own words, 'the beat way to get over somebody is to get under somebody else.' find someone else to fuck you."
2024-12-05 22:47:02,"Ah, I think DJT will nominate her as head of SEC now"
2024-12-05 22:47:11,It their own get rich bets that made them lose their money.  People don't learn to not invest money you can't afford to lose.
2024-12-05 22:47:14,Who figured she knew how to pump and dump.
2024-12-05 22:47:49,"you listened to Hawk tuah for financial advice and got upset when you got burnt?  Is this for real?  Are we really that stupid?  don't answer,its rhetorical"
2024-12-05 22:47:57,"Play stupid games get stupid results. If you bought crypto because she said to spit on that thing, you are a certifiable idiot."
2024-12-05 22:47:58,She's already in the cryptocurrency scamming stage of internet fame now!?
2024-12-05 22:48:00,Anything involving a garbage influencer always ends badly.  What did anyone expect?
2024-12-05 22:48:18,It is the own stupid people’s fault to put their life savings into it.  No one is forcing them to put their money into the token
2024-12-05 22:48:20,"People like this are going to ruin the entire thing for everyone, and regulators will force some dumb legislation and rules that break what makes crypto unique."
2024-12-05 22:48:24,"Humanity is falling into the Grand Canyon in slow motion.    Who tf keeps buying these influencer coins?!? There hasn’t been ONE instance where it wasn’t a rug pull, not ONE."
2024-12-05 22:48:42,"I know this gets brought up every time one of these VERY COMMON crypto pump and dump scams hit, but I mean…… who in the absolute fuck is putting their life savings into a hawk tuah girl coin. Its hard for me to muster up a lot of sympathy.  At this point everyone knows these meme coins are a complete gamble, a very rigged casino. Don’t take your life savings and gamble it.  Yes this is victim blaming, I also blame the perpetrator, this is scummy internet celebrity bullshit. Fame has already chewed this girl up and spit her out to the point she is doing a coin scam which I want to reiterate IS A KNOWN SCAM that countless “celebs” have done… over and over  I got news for you- if the Fleetwood mac cranberry juice skateboard guy that went semi viral a few years ago releases a coin don’t invest your life savings into it"
2024-12-05 22:48:45,Who the fuck would buy crypto from her?
2024-12-05 22:49:03,Girl is leveling up as an Influencer. The next level is becoming a child predator
2024-12-05 22:49:32,"Fools and their money…  If you put your life savings into this, you deserve to lose more than you have.  PS - MAGAnomics is going to be cutting public services across the board…. And tariffs will raise prices even higher.  Don’t expect any kind of public assistance, just like most people wanted."
2024-12-05 22:49:37,"If you bought that cryptocurrency, you deserve to lose all your money. "
2024-12-05 22:49:38,A smart person and their money might not want to take financial advise from a Hawk Tuah Girl famous for BJ techniques.
2024-12-05 22:50:20,"If you bought that, you deserve to lose your life savings"
2024-12-05 22:50:23,"If you lost your life savings by investing in hawk tuah coin, then you bought a valuable lesson and your a tool. So sorry."
2024-12-05 22:51:34,Good. Fuckin scum bag. Already gets famous from talking.and about sucking dick and then pumps and dumps to make even more money.
2024-12-05 22:52:10,People are still falling for this scam
2024-12-05 22:53:10,"Would have done the same, anyone still falling for a rug pull at this point deserves it"
2024-12-05 22:53:42,As soon as she aligned with the paul brothers i knew. Us Americans really do support the dumbest people
2024-12-05 22:54:13,Most 2024 story ever
2024-12-05 22:54:39,So she’s gonna have to spit their money back? Or does she just have to swallow this one?
2024-12-05 22:54:51,So sick of this fucking twat
2024-12-05 22:55:48,"I would love to see her serve some jail time and actually face consequences, she literally defrauded people, which is a crime in any other capacity except for crypto apparently."
2024-12-05 22:56:01,Why the fuck would anyone invest their life savings into a crypto made by someone who's claim to fame is spitting on dicks?
2024-12-05 22:56:19,Maybe I'm weird but I would expect nothing from a meme coin. But that's just me. 
2024-12-05 22:56:20,"If you bought hawk tuah coin, you deserve to lose all of your money"
2024-12-05 22:56:26,Now would be the time to buy right?? Can only pump fro here????
2024-12-05 22:56:59,“Talk tuah” judge is a top tier pun
2024-12-05 22:57:44,anybody who actually bought this crap deserved to get got
2024-12-05 22:58:08,"Play stupid games, win stupid prizes."
2024-12-05 22:58:15,"If it isn’t abundantly clear now, “that thang” she was referring to spitting on was you."
2024-12-05 22:59:01,Ngl she’s kind of a genius/idiot savant. Way to capitalize on fame!
2024-12-05 22:59:09,Nice one
2024-12-05 22:59:29,"I mean come on, how stupid do you have to be to put your life savings into Crypto founded by a person famous for spitting on an imaginary cock?"

2024-12-05 23:01:37,FAFO.

2024-12-05 23:03:07,A fool and their money are soon parted.
2024-12-05 23:04:08,Why would anyone put their life savings into an influencers shitcoin??
2024-12-05 23:04:50,Anyone who thinks the hawk tuah coin is worth anything other than $0 deserves to lose all of their money lmao
2024-12-05 23:05:06,These people were allowed to vote too 🤦🏻‍♂️
2024-12-05 23:05:19,Lmfao if you bought some fucking hawk tuah token you deserve what you got.
2024-12-05 23:05:57,damn is it too late to buy?
2024-12-05 23:06:33,"Cryptocurrency is unregulated. If she had done this with a stock it would be a crime but with cryptocurrency, as I understand it, there is no law regarding what she did.   If you bought $hawk and lost 90% of your investment there's no reason for you to sell. Just diamond hand it. At some point in the future the meme could catch on again who knows. If you put in a few thousand and you have a couple hundred left you might as well just let it sit and see what happens. Meme stocks can be crazy"
2024-12-05 23:06:44,People really thought it was a legitimate coin? People gambling does not mean they were scammed imo
2024-12-05 23:07:02,How did she get a coin going Jesus
2024-12-05 23:07:11,Hawk Tuah scandal will probably mark the turning point on clamping down on regular people accessing crypto.
2024-12-05 23:07:25,Her rugging people shows she's not just a sweet person like everyone once thought. Scummy as hell
2024-12-05 23:07:33,Nobody made you invest in her crypto- if you did invest get in early as possible and dump as soon as you think it’s reached it’s cap
2024-12-05 23:07:41,Can you still buy her cryptocurrency 
2024-12-05 23:07:49,She was America's Sweetheart and was on her way to becoming the female Warren Buffett and now this? I am shocked and heartbroken after losing my life's savings in HawkTuahCoin.
2024-12-05 23:07:51,LOL.
2024-12-05 23:08:08,Someone said it's wild she's been famous and had a podcast for 6 months and she's already doing a rug pull scam
2024-12-05 23:09:01,"She is only getting attention because she has a nice rack , that is the only thing going for her that is it. She is scumbag just like all social media stars"
2024-12-05 23:09:04,Anyone who would but cryptocurrency from her is an idiot and I have no sympathy for them. Natural selection at its finest.
2024-12-05 23:10:08,Why are people taking financial advice from a non professional.
2024-12-05 23:10:31,A fool and their money are soon parted.

2024-12-05 23:12:32,"they know their being screwed. However, they keep coming back for more, so I let them eat-greed"
2024-12-05 23:12:32,Guys really built her up and she backstabbed.
2024-12-05 23:13:35,"Yep, we're in the bull run.   Scams left and right. We're in the wild west for at most a year and a half."
2024-12-05 23:14:28,"That's why you don't buy memecoins, shitcoins and cultcoins by people ""you like and associate yourself with the community they run""."
2024-12-05 23:14:58,A fool and their money are soon parted.
2024-12-05 23:15:33,"i just think it's so funny that literally dozens of men have done this with no really consequential backlash, and the first woman that does gets such crazy backlash people are demanding she be jailed. good god yall."
2024-12-05 23:15:46,"Anyone investing in crypto deserves to lose all their money. Hate my comment all you want, argue all you want, but I'm not willing to take the chance. Get rich quick schemes, never pay off. Call me old school, I trust my gold & my land. Warren Buffet may have finally / sort of said Bitcoin was okay, but that's not good enough for me. He can afford to take a chance."
2024-12-05 23:16:25,I have zero sympathy for those dumb enough to invest their 'life savings' into a bj meme coin

2024-12-05 23:17:11,Anyone who bought her cryptocurrency with their life savings deserves to lose their life savings.
2024-12-05 23:17:19,"Man, I was kinda rooting for this girl. She had her moment and wanted to stretch it out. At first, I just saw stuff about her traveling and donation to animal shelters. I thought to myself, ""hell yeah! Fuck the doubters."" Then it was a bunch of interviews where she came across as dumb as rocks but incredibly charming.  Funny even! Then she got her own podcast and flew too close to the sun. I just don't understand why successful people can never be content."
2024-12-05 23:17:45,a fool and his money are soon parted
2024-12-05 23:17:49,"If you are that stupid to put your money on a Internet celebrity, you should lose your money."
2024-12-05 23:18:26,"I can't understand how anybody thought it was worth investing in. As the saying goes, ""a fool and their money are easily parted""."
2024-12-05 23:18:37,"Whoever bought her crypto deserves to be robbed. Morons.  With that said, i hope her and the Paul brothers drop the soap when they get their prison time."
2024-12-05 23:19:03,They weredumb enough to buy
2024-12-05 23:19:12,"""hey your the idiots who listened to me foo':"" - should totally be her response."
2024-12-05 23:19:37,"The only reason anyone bought this was to INTENTIONALLY fuck over the bigger fool.   #Which makes you a piece of shit who intentionally sought to financially ruin someone else.   What you do matters, and why you did it matters.   Fuck every single one of you that lost money on this."
2024-12-05 23:19:55,lets shut this girl down
2024-12-05 23:20:05,What kind of an idiot puts their life savings into a crypto from a blowjob girl?
2024-12-05 23:20:50,"Huh, well that sucks. :("
2024-12-05 23:22:24,Natural selection doing it's thing
2024-12-05 23:23:01,Why would anyone buy crypto from her??
2024-12-05 23:24:19,People who bought her cryptocurrency should be checked by a psychiatrist. Who in their right mind hands over money to some kid for something that has no inherent value?
2024-12-05 23:25:27,"Not long after her sudden fame, she posted a video using some of the money from it to buy dog food for a/ some - don't remember detail - dog(s).   She could have done well doing such & going with her heart.   I don't think she's a bad person - CLEARLY she's giving of nature...   But she sure did end up getting screwed by entertaining some offer. It SEEMS she really didn't know enough to protect herself... but I haven't seen much.  IF she's a good person, though, hopefully she can return to that & salvage."
2024-12-05 23:25:50,“Life savings” of her fans equals about $1800 collectively
2024-12-05 23:26:18,What made her famous?...THEN you invest...FFS...
2024-12-05 23:26:28,I bet she doesn’t even give good dome
2024-12-05 23:26:31,Explain to me what she's doing to deserve fans?   A BJ joke?  These people deserve whatever they get.
2024-12-05 23:27:05,"If you’re dumb enough to purchase some random influencer’s cryptocurrency whose entire claim to fame is a blowjob reference, you deserve to be swindled."
2024-12-05 23:27:17,"So, oral pump and dump?"
2024-12-05 23:27:28,I’m impressed there are still idiots out there putting life savings into cryptos like this. Cmon now. This ain’t the first time an influencer pulled the rug
2024-12-05 23:27:39,How the turn tables
2024-12-05 23:28:14,Everyone who loses money on crypto has nobody to blame but themselves.
2024-12-05 23:28:19,Well when Elon gets his full power as emperor we will like El Salvador go to a crypto economy
2024-12-05 23:28:44,They can’t even use her name cus nobody would know without having to speak the forbidden words 
2024-12-05 23:28:50,I like how she doesn’t even have a name anymore 😂 
2024-12-05 23:29:48,I'm usually the one to defend people for their own stupidity when it comes to crypto scams but it's happened to much already for me to care enough about their plight they have learned a valuable lesson  hopefully.  Am I just on they Internet too much or anyone else think all the bad scams that have happened should be a good indicator not to do this crap anymore.
2024-12-05 23:29:48,I mean…they put their LIFE SAVINGS on a sexual / social fad….
2024-12-05 23:30:02,Anyone stupid enough to invest their life savings on her shit deserve what they got.
2024-12-05 23:30:07,The question is why the fuck are people buying cryptocurrency from a chick who spits on dicks???
2024-12-05 23:30:09,Is Unilad really a respectable news source?
2024-12-05 23:30:37,"Her fans?  Her fans?    Oh wow, this woman likes to spit on it.  That's cool.  I'm a fan so now I have to send her my life savings now. /s  This is a Kardashian mindset.  Plastics; Plastics; Plastics"
2024-12-05 23:30:50,"Imagine looking your kid in the eye and thinking, “I got just the plan for your college education”"
2024-12-05 23:30:57,When are people going to learn that these meme coins are all scams. It’s been like 10 years of this and people are still falling for it. Can I interest anyone in an extended career warranty? Worth a shot.
2024-12-05 23:31:08,"Why would you throw your life savings into a brand new cryptocurrency? Shits crazy. It’s not an index fund, invest what you can lose and not cry over."
2024-12-05 23:31:12,The Paul's should take up position as CEOs of a specific life insurance company
2024-12-05 23:31:50,"Why in the hell do people buy this these peoples crypto scams, it's always pump and dump.  Always."
2024-12-05 23:32:09,"I don’t even invest crypto and I know that every meme coin is a pump and dump scam. No sympathy for someone putting down their kids college money on a hot 20-something’s coin, watch coffeezilla or some research outside your echo-chamber for fucks sake."
2024-12-05 23:32:40,Honestly if you are stupid enough to put your life savings into a meme coin cryptocurrency that was being peddled by the hawk tuah girl then you kinda deserve whatever ends up happening to you.
2024-12-05 23:32:54,Darwinism lol
2024-12-05 23:33:01,When speculators lose their money that is the market operating as it should.
2024-12-05 23:33:45,Am I really supposed to feel bad for those people?
2024-12-05 23:34:51,I have yet to see an example of crypto not being a massive fucking scam. The entire thing concept needs to be nuked from orbit

2024-12-05 23:37:08,Are people seriously still buying into these crypto scams? Why on earth would you invest your life savings into a financial venture from a girl famous about spitting for oral sex…
2024-12-05 23:37:21,"I'm typically on the side of those scammed, but honestly, what the fuck did people expect? How Goddamned brain-dead do you have to buy to buy something because a random woman famous for talking about dick-sucking techniques recommended it? They deserve it in all honesty."
2024-12-05 23:37:58,"Ah the Paul specialty, it's not her fault you bought her promoted products   Actual piece of shit"
2024-12-05 23:38:08,A fool and his money are easily parted. There's a reason it's a pretty well known saying.

2024-12-05 23:42:21,A woman who spits on your member is just trying to hide the fact that she doesn't swallow.
2024-12-05 23:42:27,You have to be a dumb mf to buy a coin from an influencer for saying “hawk tuah”

2024-12-05 23:43:40,15 minutes exceeded.
2024-12-05 23:44:35,She will become the Martha Steward example for all that is wrong with crypto - even though countless men have done worse in this space.
2024-12-05 23:45:10,It’s not her fault they were stupid enough to buy that crap.
2024-12-05 23:45:25,Never a guarantee.. those ppl learned investing 101
2024-12-05 23:45:50,Who in the world would buy this garbage?  Sorry but sometimes you accept your stupidity and move on
2024-12-05 23:45:57,"If you lose your life savings over a girl who got famous for saying ""hawk tuah"" then she probably deserves that money a lot more than you did."
2024-12-05 23:46:15,I don't care she did this at all lmao  Quite Franky if you're special enough to think putting down serious money on a crypto made by people of this calibre after how many have already been found to be scams you deserve to have it taken from you.
2024-12-05 23:46:38,Her 15 minutes of fame were 14 minutes too long…
2024-12-05 23:46:52,Good on her.

2024-12-05 23:47:52,This fucking country lmao.
2024-12-05 23:48:28,"The problem isn't the rugpull, it's that she lied to people buying the coins. Misleading investors is a no-no."
2024-12-05 23:48:46,"Why would anyone listen to someone they think is giving them a way to enrich themselves? These rich folks don't want you in their club, they want your money to continue to enrich them !!!  THINK ABOUT IT!!!"
2024-12-05 23:49:04,"Wait, Hawk tuah has a fucking cryptocurrency??"
2024-12-05 23:49:11,if you invested money in Hawk Tuah in anyway then you fucking deserve this outcome lmao
2024-12-05 23:49:17,“Hawk Tuah Woman”. We deserve everything we get.
2024-12-05 23:49:23,I’m still trying to figure out if there’s another killer app for crypto besides money laundering.
2024-12-05 23:49:57,when you invest in a loogie and end up with mere spittle
2024-12-05 23:50:01,How dumb do people have to be to spend their money on a crypto coin that a girl who got famous for a drunk comment about spitting on a penis sold have to be? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
2024-12-05 23:50:25,Lol morons
2024-12-05 23:50:53,What do you think she earned on the whole thing?
2024-12-05 23:50:54,She does a lot for the community in the form of hj’s. She’s really talented. She harness those big hogs with ease.
2024-12-05 23:51:25,It's your fault if you trust this bird brain twat with your money.
2024-12-05 23:51:26,Good hopefully we can finally stop hearing about the spit on dicks girl and hopefully it gets traced back to Paul bros and they taken down as well.
2024-12-05 23:51:36,Fukin morons 😂😂 good for her
2024-12-05 23:52:10,Pretty sure hawk tuah was her best advice. Spit on that thang.
2024-12-05 23:52:39,If you spent your life savings on the Hawk Tua girls crypto coin then it was a matter of time before some else stole it from you.
2024-12-05 23:53:10,Lmaooooo. It really is natural selection at this point.
2024-12-05 23:53:38,"Absolutely insane that there are actually people out there taking financial advice from a twenty-something who is famous for giving dick spitting tips.  What kind of imbecile thinks to themselves ""wow, I better drain my retirement and withdraw my kids' college funds in order to put it all into this brand new memecoin launch!"""
2024-12-05 23:53:40,"She didn't steal the money, they knew there were risks.   No sympathy whatsoever. None."
2024-12-05 23:53:52,Anyone that genuinely buys these shitcoins deserves it lol. Doubly so for people that know it’s a rug and still think they can game the system.
2024-12-05 23:53:54,She Hawk Tuahed them…
2024-12-05 23:53:56,Imagine being stupid enough to buy her crypto in the first place.  Cry me a river.
2024-12-05 23:54:26,What did they expect?
2024-12-05 23:54:27,Did people not touch the hot stove in 2021? How could you think this was not going to be a giant rug pull?  Not meaning to victim blame. The blame is on the scammers. I just would never put money in a celebrity meme shitcoin.
2024-12-05 23:54:30,"If someone got famous for saying something such as “Hawk Tuah,” why the hell would anyone buy a bitcoin from them???"
2024-12-05 23:54:40,"Would she have lost money during this, as well?"
2024-12-05 23:55:00,Will people finally stop giving this talentless moron attention?
2024-12-05 23:55:12,"Up to this point, I didn't think she did anything wrong, just ran with the fame.  Guess I can't defend her anymore."
2024-12-05 23:55:12,And what kind of fool buys this crap?
2024-12-05 23:55:17,LOL thats not how this works...
2024-12-05 23:55:44,Maybe Trump will hire her
2024-12-05 23:56:09,Are any of these scam coins by “celebrities “ ever not scams? God this is pathetic. Can’t wait for Trump to be on her podcast
2024-12-05 23:56:36,Yeah she meets jake Paul now she's doing pump and dumps smh
2024-12-05 23:56:54,What is the coin supposed to actually do? What's it's function?
2024-12-05 23:56:58,What’s the ticker? Will 300x in a week
2024-12-05 23:56:58,"I wouldn't be surprised if she doesn't understand what her management did..because she def didn't make 450m, but someone did"
2024-12-05 23:57:05,So we just out here putting our life savings into any ol crypto scheme now? Even one by somebody who majority of people who know of her existence doesn’t even know her by her name but just as the “hawk tuah girl”?
2024-12-05 23:57:06,"I feel sympathy for these people, but also, they are fucking stupid.  So I guess you get what you pay for.  So my question is:  did they learn from this?"
2024-12-05 23:57:36,Why is anyone a fan of her? Ffs people get a life.
2024-12-05 23:57:36,Who tf put their life savings in $HAWK? I mean natural selection is not solely a biological evolution. It seems to be the pillar of the financial markets.
2024-12-05 23:58:33,Trumpers gonna trump
2024-12-05 23:58:59,This is why insider trading is illegal. Crypto just hasn't caught up.
2024-12-05 23:59:04,"Crypto is a scam, if this doesn't prove it... well you're a sucker"
2024-12-05 23:59:28,"Sorry guys, I'm employed, who is this?"
2024-12-05 23:59:28,"I love watching morons lose money on shit coins.  In 2020 maybe I have sympathy.  In 2024?  Eh, you should have known better."
2024-12-05 23:59:38,looking forward to the inevitable onlyfans
2024-12-05 23:59:42,At this point it is not even a scam. At what point are we going to say that it's common sense.   It's like the Nigerian prince thing. It's so well known that if you fall for it then it's your fault

2024-12-06 00:02:05,"Idk why people buy ""creator"" crypto. Its worthless, its not like bitcoin where you can actually buy anything with it."
2024-12-06 00:02:41,how long until governments use this case as an example to put more regulations in?
2024-12-06 00:03:08,I’m not sure “being dumb” is on any return policies
2024-12-06 00:03:22,I’m sorry but if you buy a meme coin and spend your entire life savings you have no one to blame but yourself
2024-12-06 00:03:38,What does this mean? Are there free hawk tuahs with the purchase of every coin?
2024-12-06 00:04:05,Securities fraud is bad but anyone who put their life savings into this has only themselves to blame.  I honestly don't believe anyone actually did.  People buying 2 hour old memecoins know EXACTLY what they're getting into.
2024-12-06 00:04:11,I mean if you're putting your life savings into celebrity shitcoins it's your fault
2024-12-06 00:04:22,Wait she had cryptocurrency?  LAWWL
2024-12-06 00:04:38,If you thought buying her crypto was going to do something and was a good idea…….
2024-12-06 00:06:05,Did people really buy crypto from this person because they thought that she could give really good BJs?!?? WTF?
2024-12-06 00:07:01,This honestly doesn’t seem like it should be her problem.
2024-12-06 00:07:02,The Paul Brothers really pumped and dumped Hawk Tuah girl huh?
2024-12-06 00:07:36,Her podcast name was stolen from people on TikTok.  They didn’t even come up with an original name.
2024-12-06 00:08:02,"Play stupid games, win stupid prizes."
2024-12-06 00:08:27,If you take financial advice from somebody named hawk tuah girl you deserve no sympathy.
2024-12-06 00:08:30,Lmao!!!
2024-12-06 00:08:31,Anyone force these idiots to buy her crypto ?
2024-12-06 00:08:54,"Only a fool would put their life savings into crypto. I mean, the hawk tua girl crypto? Jesus people are stupid."
2024-12-06 00:09:20,Don’t hate her hate the game! You’re a straight idiot for dumping your life savings in to a meme crypto coin. Especially when not talking to a financial advisor. Darwin wins again
2024-12-06 00:09:33,"She should have just sold bibles, trading cards, nfts, or stolen designed guitars. Then people would love her."
2024-12-06 00:09:34,Does she have a name? Or did she legally change it to Spit On A Dick Girl?
2024-12-06 00:09:52,If you bought crypto from someone who you know because of what she said…    You deserve poverty.
2024-12-06 00:09:56,Am I supposed to feel something? Idiots just giving idiots more money. Nothing else to see here.
2024-12-06 00:10:01,Caveat emptor folks.  Y'all got scammed by an obvious scam
2024-12-06 00:10:07,Who would've thought a two dollar bimbo would be a scam artist.
2024-12-06 00:10:49,Why did she even have fans in the first place?
2024-12-06 00:10:54,crypto bros *want* crypto to remain unregulated. this is what unregulated means you absolute muppets.
2024-12-06 00:10:55,"She said she would spit on that thang, but instead she spit on all of us."
2024-12-06 00:12:00,Anything more than you can afford to troll on it and you deserve to lose a bunch on it.
2024-12-06 00:12:03,"Didn't that annoying Jack kid just do the same thing a week or 2 ago? It's kinda funny for most of us bc the people who lost out were the people trying to make a fast buck, they got played while trying to play that system, it's great tbh"
2024-12-06 00:13:02,Ya know…. If you were dumb enough to invest into…. The Hawk Tuah Girl’s Cryptocurrency (wtaf did I just type?) then that’s on you.
2024-12-06 00:13:13,"I doubt she really understood memecoin economics from the start, but she did put her name and brand on it. So whatever fallout comes, if any, will be placed on her shoulders.  Atleast until she gets in trouble and outs the people who are ran it."
2024-12-06 00:13:30,Is there any reason to believe she did anything illegal?  If you buy crypto aren’t you assuming risks of  scam?
2024-12-06 00:13:43,That’s right.  Keep talking and providing evidence for your prosecution.  I am not sure who is the bigger idiot.
2024-12-06 00:13:49,Why buy crypto of some nobody on the street that became famous for some silly meme? The onus of responsibility is on the consumer. Just because you can doesn’t mean you should.
2024-12-06 00:14:54,"If you're dumb enough to buy this shit in 2024, I have no sympathy for you. What kind of moron pours their life savings into this!?  Edit: Oh god, I just realized what subreddit I'm in. Sorry y'all."
2024-12-06 00:15:26,Yall can’t entirely hate on people who did this. Think about dogecoin and GameStop. Two stupid stocks that gained popularity and become incredibly profitable. Maybe people were hoping this was another trend they were getting in early for
2024-12-06 00:15:50,"My sympathy ends at self inflicted hardship.  Stupidity should come at a cost.  Otherwise, they’ll never learn"
2024-12-06 00:15:54,I remember other content creators were saying good for her for taking advantage of her popularity and that she was a smart girl and totally not a grifter 😂
2024-12-06 00:16:10,Their fault for investing in this honestly.
2024-12-06 00:16:28,Crazy out of all the ways to monetize from her fame she chose so poorly.  But also who the hell bought into this coin… So much stupid to go around.
2024-12-06 00:16:38,"How f\*ing stupid would you have to be to invest your life's savings into something like this? I hope you like the taste of cat food, because that's now your go-to food during retirement. Crypto is, in general, an efficient way to separate fools from their money. That's ALL it is."
2024-12-06 00:17:23,Wow. What one girl talking about a blowjob can do is amazing. Hawk Screwed
2024-12-06 00:17:25,Wow. Amazing
2024-12-06 00:17:26,If you bought Hawk tuah crypto then you should be in jail for criminal stupidity
2024-12-06 00:17:29,And her 15 minutes have expired.
2024-12-06 00:18:33,This is the second chick that I have read has done this. Taylor Mathis the walking bets chick got into some crypto trouble and was on her twitter crying talking about how sorry she was
2024-12-06 00:19:16,Hawktuah to all who bought her junk
2024-12-06 00:19:38,Influencers get paid to say and do things.
2024-12-06 00:19:43,What a shock that it was a grift

2024-12-06 00:20:43,Anyone dumb enough to invest in such a thing deserves to lose their investment. 🤦‍♂️
2024-12-06 00:20:54,People pissed that a meme coin got rug pulled is wild! Been there and it happened to me. I didn’t call for anyone to go to jail. It’s a risk I chose to take!
2024-12-06 00:20:56,I think the response the should get is “Buyer beware” and an explanation of what Due Diligence is!!  No sympathy!
2024-12-06 00:21:04,The people who bought in should be in jail.
2024-12-06 00:21:04,"Oh come on gimme a break, by now pretty much everyone should know at least basic stuff about crypto currency and how it works, you can't blame her"
2024-12-06 00:21:49,I read all of that but she didn’t respond 😂 and the person who said he spent they spent their life’s savings is a damn idiot 😂🤣
2024-12-06 00:22:18,"What dumbass is leveraging their life savings on a girl that said you need to spit on a dick to suck it properly?  At that point, that shit is on you. Girl should be getting her grift on. I don't give a fuck."
2024-12-06 00:22:58,I mean did she force people to buy it gun to head?
2024-12-06 00:23:10,Well if you bought anything on the advice of the hawk tuah girl you deserve to lose your ass.  Good lord
2024-12-06 00:23:25,15 minutes of fame getting her 15 years. Fingers crossed!!
2024-12-06 00:23:43,Tell me who could have predicted that the crypto currency promoted by her was gonna be worthless? Name one person who could have predicted this. Who do we trust anymore if we can’t trust a random 21 year old who became famous for saying “Hauk tua” with our life savings?
2024-12-06 00:23:45,If you were stupid enough to spend your life savings on $Hawk you deserve to lose your life savings.
2024-12-06 00:23:53,"If you bought this girl's coin, you're fucking dumber than dirt and you were bound to lose that money to a scam anyways. Cause, again, you are *dumber than fucking dirt for putting your trust in obvious con artists.*"
2024-12-06 00:24:09,Lesson learned!
2024-12-06 00:24:18,I don't think you can sue other people for you being an idiot
2024-12-06 00:24:23,"If you are stupid enough to buy into something like that, you kind of had it coming"
2024-12-06 00:26:10,How dumb do you got to be to buy hawk tua bucks? You dont deserve money go live in a box.
2024-12-06 00:27:08,"Call me old fashioned.. but if invested a crypto currency based on Hawk Tuah girl, you deserve to lose your money."
2024-12-06 00:27:14,I would suggest a class action lawsuit
2024-12-06 00:27:37,Darwinism.
2024-12-06 00:28:50,If you lost your “life savings” buying into this shit… you were gonna somehow lose it all eventually.
2024-12-06 00:31:03,If you invested in whatever this is it’s you that should go to jail.  Like really people?
2024-12-06 00:32:46,The American timeline

2024-12-06 00:33:45,"Maybe these idiots shouldn’t be blowing their kids college money on stupid internet celebrities? As absurd as this woman is, we wouldn’t have this issue if those dumb fucks wouldn’t buy into the scams in the first place. Maybe those people need a conservatorship after this bought of lunacy???"
2024-12-06 00:33:55,"Wait, she likes shame. How would that be punishment?"
2024-12-06 00:34:09,"If people are that fucking stupid to dump their life savings into a blow job meme coin, that’s not her fault."
2024-12-06 00:34:17,"Typical MAGA voter: ""Hawk Tuah has a funny name and I agree with her politics, I'll invest my life savings in her crypto"". Days Later: ""String her up, I lost my life savings"". Hawk Tuah in Mara Lago: ""I hope Trump picks me for an ambassador job""."

2024-12-06 00:34:56,"I didn't get why people ""invest"". It's a crypto standard pump and dump scam. There's been so many scams. Truly, I'm confused."
2024-12-06 00:37:18,"Is this whole thing real? People really bought an investment brought forward by Hawk Tuah? This says it all about the USofA in my opinion. I can just hear it....""Hey Ethel, Hawk Tuah got herself a coin thingy. Gonna invest all our money and gut us filthy rich!"". ""Go for it Vern. Lookit how much money Hawk Tuah made for just saying Hawk Tuah!"

2024-12-06 00:39:30,Why are we still talking about this girl and why does she have a crypto now? People are fucking stupid.
2024-12-06 00:40:06,"At this point, Crypto rugpulls are the moral thing to do. These people are to fucking stupid to have that much money. If our government made $GOV coin and rugpulled they'd probably scam enough money to fund UBI for a decade."
2024-12-06 00:40:18,Who in God's name would buy the penis slobber's crypto?
2024-12-06 00:40:46,This life is funny sometimes
2024-12-06 00:41:15,"Seriously with BTC people said the same thing who knows what the next meme method will be, but there will be people who go all in to pray they hit it like BTC. Sucks really. Stock market all of it is just a gamble. I wish fundamentals mattered"

2024-12-06 00:51:23,They hawk tuah and spit on that 35 grand 🤦‍♂️
2024-12-06 00:52:06,"Nah, if they were stupid enough to ""invest"" in a trailer park celebrity 14:58 into her 15 minutes of fame they deserve the loss. They can gather up with the ""Whats a tariff"" tRump voters and have a pity party."
2024-12-06 00:53:22,"hawk tuah coin ? ok heads you fuck off tales you fuck off, she’s been about 5 mins why would you think a coin would hold any value."

2024-12-06 00:54:15,That fan is an idiot tbh.
2024-12-06 00:55:42,How about a compromise?   She could pay ‘lip service’ and spit on everyone’s “thang”
2024-12-06 00:55:56,"Knowing this timeline, Trump will pardon her and allocate her head of Government Finance..."
2024-12-06 00:56:24,I call for people stupid enough to put their life savings into cryptocurrency to be jailed.
2024-12-06 00:57:14,It brings me joy whenever anyone loses money on crypto
2024-12-06 00:57:14,Nobody lost their life savings- all those tweets are clearly copypasta memes. Another clickbait headline.
2024-12-06 00:58:21,I have yet to see a crypto coin that isn't ultimately a scam for the average person.  Is this one of those subreddits that will ban you for criticizing the very thing it seems to exist for? Guess we're about to find out.
2024-12-06 00:59:09,"I don’t know who’s stupider the investor who lost 30,000 or hawk tuah girl."
2024-12-06 00:59:13,If you're that stupid ....
2024-12-06 00:59:20,That coin sucks....
2024-12-06 00:59:40,I mean as long as everything was legal it’s their fault. Maybe it was sketchy but if no laws are broken then they should have been a bit more wise
2024-12-06 00:59:56,Talk tuah judge lol Jesus
2024-12-06 01:01:11,Can we just end her “15 minutes “ already ? She brings nothing at all to the table .
2024-12-06 01:02:11,Idiots should not be investing. Especially in something like this. How in all good god did it get to 400 million in value. All these alts do is pump and dumps. Why do people keep doing this?
2024-12-06 01:02:15,How does one reason buying crypto (and sinking life saving in it ! ) based on BJ meme  ? 
2024-12-06 01:02:45,Wait. So you’re telling me dumping my life savings into a cryptocurrency backed by a girl famous for talking about giving head—wasn’t a solid financial decision?
2024-12-06 01:03:05,Everyone just chasin the get rich quick scheme… bitcoin fucked ppl up!

2024-12-06 01:08:34,They should list their money if they're investing in Hawk tokens😂
2024-12-06 01:08:50,They are only responsible for their own actions.
2024-12-06 01:10:36,I do not feel sorry for any idiot who spent a dime on the hawk tush girl’s obvious crypto scam.
2024-12-06 01:10:46,If you invested in a scam from some dumb chick who's only claim to fame is a blowjob joke you deserve to have lost everything you own and more.
2024-12-06 01:11:03,"You mean to tell me that the woman famous for saying you have to spit on a penis, and got a podcast out of that, may not be someone to invest my life savings with? George Carlin once said “whoever came up with buyer beware was probably bleeding from their **shole."

2024-12-06 01:11:34,C’mon….who tf buys this shot w their life savings?
2024-12-06 01:12:07,lol why are there so many dumb people? cant blame her for taking advantage of all the idiots that made her famous.

2024-12-06 01:14:42,"""I am a huge fan of Hawk Tuah but you took my life savings,"" they penned to Haliey on the social media platform. ""I purchased your coin $Hawk that you were so excited about with my life savings and children’s college education fund as well.""   I refuse to believe this is a real person. Nobody can be this dumb. I really, really, dont want this to be real. Please god"
2024-12-06 01:15:24,People being stupid is her fault?
2024-12-06 01:15:27,Isn’t she sponsored by one of the Paul brothers and ran by their team who…checks notes…did a similar thing years ago?
2024-12-06 01:15:30,Who is still falling for these things?!
2024-12-06 01:16:20,They deserved it
2024-12-06 01:16:32,"If you're investing your life savings because a YouTube meme girl told you to, you deserve what you get"
2024-12-06 01:17:36,You know what they say about fools and money. I feel no sympathy for them.
2024-12-06 01:18:18,people should be jailed for sending her money.
2024-12-06 01:20:13,You mean to tell me an unregulated currency carries innate risks that stocks protected by the federal trade commission don't?  Whaaaaaaaaat?!
2024-12-06 01:20:33,Pump and dump and hawktooey are synonymous…
2024-12-06 01:21:25,Any moron that sunk their entire “life savings” into this deserves to get fleeced.
2024-12-06 01:22:07,If you lost your life savings on a shit coin from someone with no talent other than a meme from like 4 months ago you’re an idiot and deserve to have lost all your money.
2024-12-06 01:22:08,"Just a few years ago, people would've been like ""lol look at this drunk person,"" and move on. Now, we have people throwing away money buying her crypto currency. We're in the endgame now."
2024-12-06 01:22:14,If you invested with someone known for spitting on dicks I feel like you deserve to lose your money. The fuck is this society now anyway?
2024-12-06 01:22:19,I’m shocked and I’m spitting mad. If only someone could tell me what to with all  this spit in my mouth.
2024-12-06 01:22:22,"How did our world get to a point where a girl has “fans” and becomes a celebrity because she made a dumb sexual joke.   Literally ENTIRELY because she said “you gotta hawk tuah that thang”. That is all she’s done to have “fans”, a podcast, brand deals, fame and money. What is wrong with people??  Also, I can’t believe there are so many gullible people that need to be told this, but the person who says they invested 35k of their child’s college fund into this tramps meme coin is trolling. It’s not real, their whole account is satire and trolling. But no doubt about it, there were people that invested in that stupid coin, and lost their money because hawk tuah tramp set that shit up. She’s just another greedy unethical nasty heathen who wants to milk money out of any poor sucker she can."
2024-12-06 01:24:18,"We are an increasingly stupid, gullible and chubby Nation.  We probably deserve most of what happens to us 🤷🏾‍♂️"

2024-12-06 01:26:04,Can't help idiots..
2024-12-06 01:26:22,You would think scam after scam ppl would stop buying cryptocurrency.
2024-12-06 01:26:27,I think the bigger question is why are people spending their “life savings” on digital currencies being sold by a girl that rose to stardom by explaining that a good date needs some spit to make it better…sounds like more of a self inflicted wound honestly
2024-12-06 01:26:32,When's bitcoin's turn?
2024-12-06 01:28:00,Turns out the only thing she decentralized was their bank accounts.

If you put your life savings in a woman famous like and for this, you well deserve to be poor, homeless and in the bottom of the feeding chain.

2024-12-06 01:51:56,"She became a millionaire in a year. Who cares, she’s set for life"
2024-12-06 01:52:08,She should have spit on it first.
2024-12-06 01:52:31,They deserved it lmao
2024-12-06 01:52:57,Where's the clips she did the Hawk Tuah?
2024-12-06 01:53:06,all crypto is a scam anyways so the people getting into it need to take accountability
2024-12-06 01:53:07,What about Baron Trump?
2024-12-06 01:53:45,Imagine investing in something based on a something a girl said about sucking dick
2024-12-06 01:54:07,"You lost all your money to a girl name hawk tuah, that’s on you bro."
2024-12-06 01:55:13,"When will folks learn that memecoins are for memes, not individuals"
2024-12-06 01:55:25,LOL to all the stupid MFers that elevated absolute shit to whatever fame she had. Dumb cocksuckers!
2024-12-06 01:55:51,"If you’re stupid enough to invest money in a person who made a blow job joke, then you are the joke. I have no sympathy whatsoever for anyone who lost money on this."
2024-12-06 01:57:30,LOL!!
2024-12-06 01:58:55,How dumb do you have to be to buy it in the first place?
2024-12-06 01:59:14,So is now the time to buy?
2024-12-06 01:59:58,How is any of it her fault people lost money.   Unless of course she was a significant dumper.
2024-12-06 02:00:01,"I just don’t get it, she hits it big in the stupidest fucking way and then gets greedy? Just chill"
2024-12-06 02:00:17,"“This is one of the most miserable, horrible launches I’ve ever seen. I’ve been tracing it on the chain for a while. You guys generated over a million dollars in fees, while your fans got rug pulled. There were snipers, but there was also insider trading directly linked to y’all’s creator accounts.”  What is an example of a “good” launch of a sh*t coin? By definition it’s a sh*t coin."
2024-12-06 02:01:10,Fans? Bought her cryptocurrency? 🤦‍♀️
2024-12-06 02:02:45,"If you bought into that pumping dump, you're a f****** idiot and you deserve none of that money that you lost."
2024-12-06 02:02:58,Its 2024…. Elon did it with Doge and SBF with FTX… i mean come one who hasnt been rugged pulled?
2024-12-06 02:03:06,So she ran a pump n dump? I havent caught the news yet.
2024-12-06 02:04:44,A fool and his money are easily parted
2024-12-06 02:04:47,"So a ton of morons tried to get rich, spent money on a gamble, lost, and are blaming someone else…..   i too get mad at vegas…"
2024-12-06 02:04:56,She did it to make money and made money while others lost money.  She’ll be on trump’s team before you know it.
2024-12-06 02:05:24,I promise to listen if she podcasts from prison.
2024-12-06 02:05:54,How much did she make off of the coin launch?
2024-12-06 02:06:11,Not her fault people are dumb enough to buy it
2024-12-06 02:06:43,If you're dumb enough to buy crypto...
2024-12-06 02:06:44,"She did one vid that went viral, and not she has crypto? I missed this completely. What happened?? Was there more content of her?"
2024-12-06 02:07:02,Everyone gets one spit on that thang.
2024-12-06 02:07:33,All because she knew how to spit on that thang!
2024-12-06 02:08:19,Is this a joke > who would buy this
2024-12-06 02:09:01,"As much as she is rusted, busted, stanky trash garbage, she isn’t responsible for people losing their life savings. They are."
2024-12-06 02:09:44,How are people still dumb enough to buy shit-coins?
2024-12-06 02:09:49,"I know everyone is making jokes here, but for the layperson such as myself who knows nothing about crypto, what exactly makes this a criminal act? Were these people not essentially gambling on the coin being successful or is there a more sinister aspect to this?"
2024-12-06 02:09:53,1789
2024-12-06 02:10:00,What did she say? Im not clicking that cancerous link.
2024-12-06 02:10:15,People really stupid enough to put their life savings into a crypto coin that’s backed by a walking meme really have nothing to cry about
2024-12-06 02:10:44,How did it start off being worth $430 million? I don't think I'll ever understand crypto
2024-12-06 02:11:01,At this point I cannot believe people still trust any 'investment vehicles' the 'influencers' recommend.  These people deserve losing everything they stupidly 'invested' with these scammers.
2024-12-06 02:12:39,honestly if people are that dumb to invest in a pump and dump scam i don’t feel bad for them.
2024-12-06 02:12:48,You spent your life savings on a meme coin....   Like yeah she's a pos but come on. Use your brain a little bit. Her 15 minutes is pretty much over. You're basically wasting money on a dead meme.   If you're going to buy a meme coin at least pick one that's still relevant currently.
2024-12-06 02:13:37,"If you put your life savings into any kind of crypto, you deserve to lose it all."
2024-12-06 02:14:03,"Why does every article written about her feel the need to explain the back story about how she rose to fame by from what she said on camera? Does anyone even read that crap?   It’s like how they still say, “…he said it on X (formerly Twitter)”"
2024-12-06 02:14:38,And Logan Paul’s gonna keep getting away w it … okay makes sense
2024-12-06 02:15:11,"Someone coached her on this scumbag trajectory, probably some other podcast crypto hack douchbags"
2024-12-06 02:16:22,"If you are the kind of person stupid enough to invest life savings into cryptocurrency, i have absolutely no sympathy for you when you act surprised by the very obvious outcome."
2024-12-06 02:17:10,Only full blown idiots would buy a hawk tuah shitcoin. They deserve it.
2024-12-06 02:17:20,"Her podcast was popular, God knows why. But she wanted more MORE. 0 chance she goes to prison and im pretty sure she has 0 idea what was occurring with her coin. The 2 other douchebags though."
2024-12-06 02:17:33,People really are this stupid?
2024-12-06 02:17:39,Shoulda been Tuahcoin.
2024-12-06 02:17:40,The revolution will not be televised or tweeted. Check Reddit tho
2024-12-06 02:17:59,"Honestly if anyone out their life savings into a pop up crypto from a girl famous for ""Hawk Tuah"" i have no sympathy. That kind of person is short sighted, thinking they were going to make a quick score, and were bound to lose that money one way or another."
2024-12-06 02:19:48,Looks like she is gonna progress from getting money from talking about sucking dick to getting money from sucking dick.
2024-12-06 02:20:57,"The fact that this is at all getting any traction, lets me know just how fucking utterly dumb our country has become."
2024-12-06 02:21:16,Idiots and their money are easily parted….
2024-12-06 02:22:45,Good those people do not deserve the money.
2024-12-06 02:23:04,Why did she have fans?
2024-12-06 02:23:16,Cliffsnotes?
2024-12-06 02:23:41,"What’s crazy is if she would have slowly sold it, she mad not has made as much money but actually may have stabilized just because of the meme of it and no one would have batted an eye. Like slowly sell over 3-6 months and no one comes for her."
2024-12-06 02:24:14,Is there any indication she did this intentionally or is it just the nature of a new coin?  Only difference is this one seems to be tied to a recognizable name/person unlike the many others which probably had a similar fate.
2024-12-06 02:24:24,Currently split down the middle between hating anyone who does one of the crypto schemes and having trouble sympathizes with anyone willing to put any money at all towards one
2024-12-06 02:24:29,Currently split down the middle between hating anyone who does one of the crypto schemes and having trouble sympathizes with anyone willing to put any money at all towards one
2024-12-06 02:24:35,Morons. Morons everywhere.
2024-12-06 02:24:36,"god people are stupid. I had no idea she was releasing a coin but what did people expect?  you could literally release a a crypto called ""scamcoin"" and people would spit on it and gobble it up."
2024-12-06 02:25:09,Has anyone ever actually had a girl spit on their penis? I want to ask my wife but feel weird. I wish I knew hawk tuah girl when I was single. I would be rich.
2024-12-06 02:25:17,"At one point someone tweeted to her that they bought $35,000 worth of the crypto and within 10 mins it was worth $2,000, stating it was their life savings AND their kid’s college fund, and I hate to say it but…..most of me doesn’t have any sympathy for a person that would be that stupid.  $35k is all you have for your life savings and child’s college and you thought, hey why don’t I invest it ALL in a made up currency started or promoted by a girl who got famous for saying she’d spit on a penis? That’s like seeing a burning building, walking inside, setting the door on fire and then complaining there’s no way out."
2024-12-06 02:25:26,"I'm sorry, but if you put any more money on this ridiculous coin than you would spend on a lottery ticket then you are an idiot."
2024-12-06 02:25:36,"I am DUMBFOUNDED that a random off hand middle-school ""joke"" has wasted so much of humanities time this year. I hate to be a doomer but this one broke me, we're screwed."
2024-12-06 02:26:06,There is actually this crypto?...jesus..
2024-12-06 02:26:49,I need to learn a lot about crypto. Can anyone just launch their own coin?
2024-12-06 02:27:00,Got damn. All I want is a little notoriety so I can level up and toke up with Iron Mike Tyson
2024-12-06 02:28:12,Had they became rich would they still be mad? I lost $73k in 2001 on SYTE stock because I was stupid. Skitrsde recommended but I never blamed him.
2024-12-06 02:28:35,"So you're saying 'buy the dip', got it"
2024-12-06 02:28:59,If you lost your life savings buying this you deserve it..100% 😂
2024-12-06 02:29:17,WHO GIVES A FUCK! I do not!
2024-12-06 02:29:45,"OK, I think it's finally time...I've been putting it off for months.     Who the fuck is this chick and why should I care?"
2024-12-06 02:30:55,None of these words are in the Bible
2024-12-06 02:31:29,You gotta subscribe to BrainRot + to fall for coin-based scams
2024-12-06 02:32:10,**ALL** crypto is a scam
2024-12-06 02:32:59,Honesty... I think if you bought into it you kinda deserve it.
2024-12-06 02:35:01,"Instead of using her fame for onlyfans, she decided to watch everyone else get fucked."
2024-12-06 02:35:02,These morons that bought it DESERVE this. Keep making piss-poor choices 🙄
2024-12-06 02:35:05,"This guy was an idiot, but is there even any legal recourse for him? Like can he sue someone for enabling/encouraging him to make stupid choices"
2024-12-06 02:35:34,Can we just fucking forget about this lady
2024-12-06 02:36:20,I mean what do you expect… to get it back?
2024-12-06 02:36:25,Just the fact that she spelled the word fees as fee's tells me she's an idiot who got remarkably lucky.  I hope she and the Pauls wind up in a cell. What a stupid time to be alive.
2024-12-06 02:36:27,A fool and their money are soon parted
2024-12-06 02:36:33,Cryptos existence is only in the mind. Ur better off giving me all your money😄
2024-12-06 02:37:08,"If I were to go back in time and explain this to myself in the 90s, this would be very hard to understand:   “Yea so this 20 something y/o girl was drunk and being interviewed on a phone camera (we combined the 2 technologies) and she was explaining how to enhance a blow job by spitting on the penis and somehow by the graces of God, it spread like wild fire and she is easily now recognizable by over 10 million+ humans, id estimate.  Well after only about 6 months of fame, she decides to create a digital based decentralized crypto currency based on her blowjob slogan “hawk Tuah” after many other celebs/public figures also attempted to create some meme based mimicry of the selectively few successful crypto coin decentralized currencies, like Bitcoin and Ethereum.  Hers also turned out to be unsuccessful and potentially a scam that cause many of her “followers” to lose their savings or a portion of it.”"
2024-12-06 02:37:48,"If you gave up your life savings on this, then you deserved to lose it all."
2024-12-06 02:38:43,I was just explaining to someone the other day that literally anyone can create cryptocurrency.
2024-12-06 02:40:03,"When are they going to learn, that the whole thing is a scam 😂"
2024-12-06 02:40:46,"Man, who could have predicted that HawkTuah Coin wasnt going to be the path to financial freedom. I was so certain it was gonna become the US reserve currency."
2024-12-06 02:41:14,"If you waste your life savings on something because a literal meme told you to, you deserve it."
2024-12-06 02:41:41,"You know the ol saying don't bet what you cannot afford to lose? Well that goes the same with investing! Anyone lost money over this crypto, that's your own bad!"
2024-12-06 02:41:48,Talk tuah judge
2024-12-06 02:41:52,She’s just doing her job teaching the community about rug-pulling.
2024-12-06 02:41:59,This is such a strange timeline to be alive in.
2024-12-06 02:42:25,Can’t say I have much sympathy for people dumb enough to fall for this after he countless crypto scams…
2024-12-06 02:42:50,TLDR what did she respond?
2024-12-06 02:44:01,If you are involved with crypto in any way and aren’t scamming people you’re a sucker. Sorry!
2024-12-06 02:44:07,"This is another Logan Paul crypto scam, she was just the face of it and likely has no idea how she was used. Well she probably realizes now after Paul exited."
2024-12-06 02:44:46,I feel like if you put your life savings into Hawk Tuah crypto you kind of deserve it.
2024-12-06 02:44:47,Random thought entering my head as I “came” across this post:  I wonder if she swallows.
2024-12-06 02:46:35,Anyone that dumped their life savings in a shitty meme coin deserves it.
2024-12-06 02:46:58,I more surprised this was a real thing. I thought it was a story from the onion.
2024-12-06 02:47:08,crypto is always a scam
2024-12-06 02:47:27,Probably why it’s called a “meme coin”
2024-12-06 02:48:07,People didn’t complain when the pastor from Colorado made his church members buy his coin
2024-12-06 02:49:08,Those morons deserve to lose their money
2024-12-06 02:50:22,People investing their entire net worth in a meme coin just shows how desperate some people’s situations are. Sad really.
2024-12-06 02:50:41,I just hope their life savings didn’t exceed 1000 bucks cause that’s all I’m willing to bet on a meme coin.
2024-12-06 02:51:04,A fool and his money are soon parted.
2024-12-06 02:51:11,The fact that this woman has a show and is some sort of celebrity now is mind bending. Maybe someone can get Kyle Rittenhouse and her together to do some sort of cable TV show. I think the MSNBC morning Joe show might end soon so that time slot will be free...🤔
2024-12-06 02:52:11,I’m so glad this is happening to people who did this.
2024-12-06 02:52:15,"I don’t understand why everyone is so crazy about this girl and her catch phrase, I don’t want my girl spitting straight up loogies on me. That hawk is bringing up the deep shit. 🤮"
2024-12-06 02:53:41,people believe that she’s a internet planet yet?
2024-12-06 02:58:00,What happened to being responsible for your stupid financial decisions?
2024-12-06 02:58:27,I would just hold. I can definitely see this going back up and down and up and down and up and down and up and down.
2024-12-06 02:59:52,Of all the people to buy crypto from people are buying hers? 🤨  Like…. Really   Nah….. some of these dummies should be jailed for their own stupidity instead buying from her 😐
2024-12-06 02:59:58,I feel like I heard this story on one of the radio stations on grand theft auto
2024-12-06 03:01:09,"I never thought of my life savings and just thought hey, let's just spit on this thang."
2024-12-06 03:02:00,Reality has become reality tv.
2024-12-06 03:02:36,Everyone that bought the meme coin had the same plan to pump and dump. Meme coins are just a game of ponzi scheme chicken.
2024-12-06 03:03:01,"Ahh, the rise and fall of fickle fame. Who will play her in the tv movie?"
2024-12-06 03:03:11,This is natural selection at it’s best
2024-12-06 03:04:13,She should start an onlyfans to make the money back
2024-12-06 03:04:16,Spit on that thang.
2024-12-06 03:04:21,They really thought it would be a good coin based on what hawk tuah is? Lmao.
2024-12-06 03:04:37,That's what they get for making her so famous lol i never understood nor cared for the craze for her.
2024-12-06 03:04:47,That fact society has made someone like her into an ‘icon’ is mind boggling.
2024-12-06 03:06:14,"On one hand, she ran a crypto scam, plain and simple  On the other hand, you have to be pretty fucking dumb to put money into this"
2024-12-06 03:06:20,You gotta get that crypto going and give it a Hawk Tuah!
2024-12-06 03:07:02,Whomp whomp…..a fool and their money are soon parted 😂
2024-12-06 03:07:35,We are living in Idiocracy 2.
2024-12-06 03:09:08,People that spent their life savings on this deserve to lose their money
2024-12-06 03:10:03,They deserved to lose their money if following this dumb shits advice
2024-12-06 03:11:06,What does sniper mean?
2024-12-06 03:13:20,Well at least they still have their dignity   Hahahahah of fuck I tried to say it with a straight face. Can’t do it.
2024-12-06 03:14:14,"If you bought a cryptocurrency based on the spitty blowjob girl we all fell in love with earlier this year, you deserve whatever losses you incurred."
2024-12-06 03:16:51,Haha!! She deserves jail time for this as much as McDonald's deserves lawsuits for people getting fat. 😂 People just can't seem to accept responsibility for their actions.
2024-12-06 03:17:15,Fools and $.....
2024-12-06 03:17:20,How have these influencer pump and dumps become legal? Aren't  there laws against this.  I mean I believe anyone with a winning catch phrase should make more than true professionals but this just seems criminal.( Ps I am old).
2024-12-06 03:18:17,She was handed a lottery ticket to an easy luxurious life and she threw it away by getting suckerd in by a bunch of crooks
2024-12-06 03:18:30,Why would anyone educated buy crypto from her?
2024-12-06 03:18:55,How much of  a dumb fuck do you have to be in order to buy and believe in a crypto currency promoted by a woman who got famous for drunkenly describing oral sex on a youtube video? Some people deserve it.
2024-12-06 03:18:58,Do it
2024-12-06 03:20:22,If you bought into this bs you deserved to be scammed.
2024-12-06 03:21:08,When I first heard this story I thought it was a satire from the Onion
2024-12-06 03:21:24,"""I am a huge fan of Hawk Tuah but you took my life savings,""...  A couple of thoughts...   1. What kind of boring idiot is a ""big fan of hawk tuah"" there is nothing there to be a fan of, just grifters using a meme to bilk dummies  2. If you put your life savings into this you deserved to lose every penny that you did and you honestly should not be allowed to have any more money in the future."
2024-12-06 03:22:41,"I’m sorry, Hawk Tuah girl is a crypto expert? I’m sorry ppl lost money but cmon"

2024-12-06 03:28:37,"So she actually hasn't responded, shit article."
2024-12-06 03:30:03,So what’s her spiel? Some guy asked her a question and she responded by explaining how to give a blowjob and things took off from there for her?
2024-12-06 03:30:34,Zero empathy
2024-12-06 03:30:37,"Should financial fraud like this be heavily prosecuted?  Absolutely. But like on the other hand, natural selection has to do its thing right?  If you invested any money into this for any reason you deserve to lose it all lol"
2024-12-06 03:30:43,I knew this was going to happen.  Nothing good can come out of the paul brothers.  They be assholes.
2024-12-06 03:31:43,Wth would anyone buy a new crypto currency?   Would you go to the casino with your life savings and place it all on one bet!?
2024-12-06 03:32:25,There’s a Hawk Tua born every minute.
2024-12-06 03:33:25,"And people think men have privileges. No man on earth could ever replicate her instant rise to riches and fame. It’s just the craziest thing I’ve ever seen. All it took was a relatively mid girl showing no shame and no class. I could be crass and classless in my sleep. I’d get paid zero dollars and lose my last friend, lmao."
2024-12-06 03:34:28,Oh wow someone associated with Logan Paul and Mr Beast might be slightly scammy and with crypto no less.  I'm so shocked.  /s

I remember being poor, living in El Salvador and there being like 8 of us in one house. Sometimes we'd have a chicken, beans, rich and tortillas to eat... Sometimes I would get greedy and I'd take more chicken than I should. I would get my ass beat... SOMETIMES I would try to be slick...I'd grab a thich connected to a leg and try to claim it was one piece.... I'd get my ass beat harder... you know why ? Because my uncle knew I fucking knew it was a bs story. I decided that the savory chicken was for me, damn whoever didn't get to eat any as long as i was full and happy with how much chicken I had.   It's insane how people now forgive and forget like nothings happened. Even the people getting fucked are likec* you know what... it's my fault, I should of never walked down cypress ave in a miny dress. I deserved to get raped* OH she has a funny joke about sloppy blowjobs, why the fuck didn't you say so! - It's ok sweetie, you did no wrong here. You're cute and funny and enjoy giving head, you're an angel doing God's work. Don't worry about all that, that's just money. You know what. In fact, here's a show, funding and sponsors.

May it’s good it happened with a more obvious scam, otherwise these people would’ve invested more than they got to in a matter of minutes, rather than slowly draining their savings with false promises by a more experienced scammer.  Honestly, good for her, she just speed ran every Gen-Z dream of fame and money in a few months. You don’t do that by accident."

2024-12-06 04:20:26,"I still haven't looked into what she said or did to earn fame she could leverage into a crypto scam. I could be famous and be used to dupe people if any organizations are interested in making me famous for any of my legitimate talents, photogenic looks, and sharp mind. Or does being worthy actually disqualify me from participating in late stage capitalism? I'll be around if you change your mind..."
2024-12-06 04:20:40,So I had sympathy for people losing their life savings on shit like this in 2017... but in seven years later I'm sorry if you are chasing meme coins and getting burned in the process you deserve to become a meme.

2024-12-06 05:10:53,"I have to ask, who thinks that woman is a good investment in crypto?  Or anything?"
2024-12-06 05:12:54,">The coin's value completely tanked within 20 minutes of its launch - plummeting from as much as $490 million to just $41 million, leaving fans out of pocket.  How was it worth $490 million if it just launched? How is that determined?"

2024-12-06 05:31:09,Why would anyone buy her coin?  It confuses me to no end as to why anyone would risk real life money on something intangible as hawk tuah coin then get sad when they lose it all. Let’s give monetary value to cheese its and get mad when they get sold in droves by nabidco.
2024-12-06 05:31:09,Let’s be real propel running her brand did this.  You really think this person had any idea how to start a crypto currency?

2024-12-06 05:35:50,Seems like she was really passionate about one thing. You know. What made her famous. Don’t know why people would suddenly think to invest in a cryptocurrency by her. Absolute idiots
2024-12-06 05:37:59,Who tf invested their life savings into hawk tuah girls crypto?

2024-12-06 05:43:34,"“So... it turns out the Hawk Tauh crypto meme coin was not a good investment.”  Ya think???? JFC, these people are dumber than a bag of dicks. What in the freaking world made you think that buying ANYTHING from a MEME celebrity was gonna be of any value? Let alone crypto. My thinking is go ahead and let them buy this crap and let them drink their bleach and ivermectin. They all deserve it."
2024-12-06 05:43:42,Putting your life savings on the line for anything is really really dumb particularly Crypto. Someone really thought it would be a good idea to invest into one created by a meme?
2024-12-06 05:44:41,"It's bizarre that people are saying she should be jailed for the crypto buyer's piss poor judgement.  Hawk Tuah was a viral meme, and would obviously have no long term longevity as a celebrity or cultural phenomenon.  Furthermore, don't ever financially ruin yourself with high volatility high risk investments."
2024-12-06 05:45:59,I feel like people who dump their life savings into a blowjob meme digital currency known for scams never received any hard ledsons in life and this is nature balancing the scales.   And fuck these goons for trying to barge in on the spotlight shining on Americans gleefully tapdancing next to the corpse of some cunt CEO scumbag.

2024-12-06 05:53:10,It's like she didn't see what happened to Brian Thompson
2024-12-06 05:54:13,There is no fiduciary responsibility for crypto right? There's absolutely not value to coin other than what someone is willing to pay for it. It can't be insider trading since there was info to go off of. They purchased an item at an inflated price when it had no actual value. Sucks to suck. I hope she got rich of the fuck tards that purchased
2024-12-06 05:54:34,"I'm sorry, but anyone who gave this woman money and lost most of it is basically just validating the old aphorism about a fool and his money."

2024-12-06 05:56:44,Imagine giving an idiot like this a platform and not expect her to scam 😂
2024-12-06 05:56:59,Everyone who bought “Hawkcoin” or whatever deserve every bit of the loss
2024-12-06 05:57:00,Isn’t all crypto a scam? It’s just a question of how many people are in the Ponzi scheme you are in. Trump is going to allow for even less regulation with his crypto czar. Enjoy folks 
2024-12-06 05:58:03,"Cryptocurrency is notoriously volatile. The real challenge isn't just buying in—it's knowing when to cash out. Identifying the peak is the hardest part. Early adopters who sold at the right time made a lot of money, while others saw their investments vanish. As the saying goes, never invest money you can't afford to lose. By that measure, Hawk Tuah girl didn’t do anything wrong."
2024-12-06 05:59:55,"Ppl got hawk tuah'd on lol, who would be even dumb enough to buy her crypto currency."
2024-12-06 06:00:18,But what about all the meme coins that did the exact same thing? Why are they not in jail?

2024-12-06 06:11:01,Tell her to stay out of Midtown Manhattan
2024-12-06 06:11:28,Sorry but if you put money into a meme that is your own fault. It is a meme. It isn't an investment vehicle. That is like going to the Casino betting on Black and Red and it coming up Green on the roulette wheel
2024-12-06 06:22:22,"2 weeks fame, then back to the random npc she is, cant accept it and become a scammer. Classic"
2024-12-06 06:22:27,"How can anyone see all these brand new cryptos and drop an inordinate amount of money in a new one?  I get taking a chance with a few bucks, but damn"

2024-12-06 06:26:59,At this point if you're still falling for these scams maybe you deserve it.

2024-12-06 07:26:28,So many thoughts popped into my head so I’ll sum them up by saying: That’s their own stupid fault.
2024-12-06 07:27:59,If you're dumb enough to eat it you deserve to die
2024-12-06 07:28:48,\#BlockTuah  I can't stand that fuck-ugly beaver face of hers and I knew I was right about her from the start. PoS. Then we find out she's suing the guys who made her famous after she obv left them behind. Now she pulls this shit. Called it. I love that she made such a dumb move & spat a little venom at Coffeezilla though 😆

2024-12-06 07:40:40,I'm trying to figure out how what she did was a crime.
2024-12-06 07:41:23,"Falling for crypto scams is so 2022, do people not follow the news? I see bullshit like that no different from buying Delphine's bathtub water, gotta be a special kind of stupid to invest blindly especially when you're using critical money you need to live."

2024-12-06 07:52:43,This is what lack of regulation is. When Reagan deregulated Wall St the first thing to happen were scams like this.
2024-12-06 07:53:32,How is it a scam. She sets up a block chain and sells the tokens. Where do people think the value will.come from? Its 100% a pyramid scheme like literally all crypto
2024-12-06 07:53:51,Why do people buy these coins? Does it not always end up with the value tanking?  Has a celeb coin ever maintained a decent value?
2024-12-06 07:54:08,Why in any universe would you buy crypto from someone that had a 30 second video.  It’s not even 15 minutes of fame. It was a 30 second video.
2024-12-06 08:00:15,"The way she (briefly) spoke to Coffeezilla highlighted exactly who she is.  I'm sure she has no idea wtf Crypto even is for the most part, and someone with more knowledge is simply using her brand to scam people & provided she's getting her cut she's cool with it, who could have known the hawk tuah girl was more trashy than classy."

Its Always the Same, basically everything that goes viral IS purely Made Up. ITS Not real. There are companies behind this, that use their ressources to generate clicks and make artifical Hits and success. ITS a Business to Part the Money from the fools.   At this Point i have to say, ITS purely embarassing If people spend a single dime for this "" celebreties"" No Matter what way. If you are so dumb to defend and God forbid, spend Money on these grifters it tells that you dont think straight. Put Out a Woman, let her make a Thing about Sex, and than use this to squezte the Money Out of idiots. They artifically pump the currency and they exactly know when to jumo from the top, from this Point ITS a Game of who bails fast enough to gain a little. The big bottom stays with all the loss.

2024-12-06 09:05:23,Does anyone have a rough idea how much real money went in?  Not the market cap high but the actual dollars that were lost.
2024-12-06 09:07:29,"I don't follow social media, I don't buy crypto.  I really don't know much about this wo,man's story but I'm happy that she got her turn at the jackpot just by being herself.  She wasn't trying to ""influence"" people or doing wild stunts to get attention.  She was just caught up in a mania that will fade soon enough.  I hope she profits from it and isn't manipulated by the Paul brothers to the point that she regrets her moment.  It would probably be wise for her to begin looking for the exit.  The people who claim to have lost their life savings are either begging for attention or Luddites who want to dictate how everyone should live.  If they truly did lose their savings, that's unfortunate, but it is the cost of being uninformed, unwilling to learn and wanting to get rich without expending effort."
2024-12-06 09:08:21,there's a sucker born every day.

2024-12-06 09:12:31,How would it ever NOT be a scam? How was it going to profit or go up in value?  The people that bought the coin are members of the Leopards Ate My Face Party. They planned on ripping someone else off later in time. But they got ripped off when they got caught off guard by the immediate rug pull / leopard eating face

2024-12-06 10:42:21,She shoulda stuck to podcasting and influencing. This fiasco will fuck all that up....she's ruined IMO
2024-12-06 10:42:37,If you’re stupid enough to buy a meme coin you only deserve to get what you get out of it.
2024-12-06 10:46:20,Are we also to feel bad for the guy that bought GameStop the day after their moment in the sun?
2024-12-06 10:46:21,"Lol, survival of the fittest. The idiots who bought her coin learned a lesson."
2024-12-06 11:00:38,Who the fuck buys these coins?
2024-12-06 11:03:11,It's crazy that people still buy meme coins that celebs are promoting
2024-12-06 11:09:52,Anyone investing their life savings into a meme coin from a one liner girl deserves to be broke
2024-12-06 11:16:22,"To be fair if you invest in .... i don't actualy know, what you would be investing.  But you should not be allowed to handle your own money."
2024-12-06 11:17:19,"lol, good luck with that."
2024-12-06 11:21:49,Apparently I need a coin... smh. I am too scared of jail lol
2024-12-06 11:31:32,"""Off with her head!""...not really ..just saw Through the Looking glass ..sounded appropriate 😋"
2024-12-06 11:31:50,I guess people are still fallin for these crypto scams.
2024-12-06 11:32:27,Why would anyone think that giving away money to someone who doesn’t have any experience in financial matters 🤣
2024-12-06 11:34:11,Should the losing horses people gamble on be jailed? Meme coins are pump and dump pyramid schemes.
2024-12-06 11:38:07,Next thing you're gonna tell me is that she doesn't even spit.
2024-12-06 11:50:14,gambling with your money usually doesn't pay off. this is not news.
2024-12-06 11:50:45,"A fool and his money…something something.  I mean, anyone buying these celebrity shitcoins should be well aware by now that it’s always a scam."
2024-12-06 11:54:22,She gonna be spittin’ on that thang now.
2024-12-06 11:55:05,Did she actually scam anyone or did stupid people invest in something created by a person known as Hawk Tuah and expected to make money?
2024-12-06 12:05:57,such a titanic skank
2024-12-06 12:06:30,"If you’re dumping your life savings into Hawk Tua’s cryptocurrency, you deserve to lose it…"
2024-12-06 12:10:17,Good time to invest. Buy during the dip and hold on with diamond hands.
2024-12-06 12:14:49,She has joined the list of celebrity coins that went to zero
2024-12-06 12:15:34,Im glad this shit never popped up for me until after it failed 😌😌😌
2024-12-06 12:17:55,"shes famous and already makes alot of money via legitimate sources, but still needs to go out of her way to scam people. what is wrong with people"
2024-12-06 12:18:22,Anyone who invested deserved to lose every penny.   This random nobody should never have gotten famous for a stupid phrase 
2024-12-06 12:24:02,"If you run a scam, you're a piece of shit.  But if someone sells you a magic lighter that they say will turn your cash to gold, you're still an idiot if you ignite your life savings with it."
2024-12-06 12:25:37,We actually live in an age where the expression of spit collecting (Hawk) is a currency 😭😭😭😭 what have we done
2024-12-06 12:29:12,"To be fair, if you're entrusting someone famous for 'spitting on that thang' with your money,you kind of deserve to learn your lesson the hard way..."
2024-12-06 12:29:21,I’ve been waiting for what would end her ten minutes of fame.  Will this be it?
2024-12-06 12:30:01,"Pump and dumps, illegal sales, and moving sums of money in obscurity is the whole point of crypto.  That's what these clowns invested in.    Did they really act like domino's would sell pizza for a hawtuah?"
2024-12-06 12:30:23,"Play stupid games, win stupid prizes."
2024-12-06 12:34:46,The logic on this sub is so flawed. Putting the hawk tuah girl in jail for this would be like putting President Obama in jail for someone robbing a bank wearing a President Obama mask.
2024-12-06 12:36:18,"These people really took investment advice from an internet celebrity that got famous for giving blowjob advice and have the audacity to act surprised that it didn't work out, lmao."
2024-12-06 12:37:01,honestly if you yolo'd into a shitcoin like this then quite frankly you deserve the loss. shit like this is why people dont trust or invest in crypto.
2024-12-06 12:37:07,honestly if you yolo'd into a shitcoin like this then quite frankly you deserve the loss. shit like this is why people dont trust or invest in crypto.
2024-12-06 12:39:43,"No, average looking girl made famous by making one joke about blowjobs, how could you betray our special kinship."
2024-12-06 12:42:06,"What kind of idiot gambles life saving on clear scam like this, is beyond me."
2024-12-06 12:43:06,"People who cheered for unregulated, decentralized currency begging the government to help them when they lose their real currency. Fuck these idiots."
2024-12-06 12:44:33,"Honestly anyone dumb enough to have bought that coin kinda deserves it.  Like don't invest in obvious scams, easy."
2024-12-06 12:45:03,Greed and narcissism are rampant these days.
2024-12-06 12:45:31,A dumbass is soon separated from their monies
2024-12-06 12:47:34,"They chose to buy, not her fault"
2024-12-06 12:48:58,"Scummy thing to do. But if you're stupid enough to buy these peoples crypto scams, then that's your own dumbass fault."
2024-12-06 12:49:22,There are shitty porns by the dozen with chicks way hotter than her who are better at her special talents.. why would you ever buy her crypto token?? Seriously
2024-12-06 12:50:44,If it’s to good to be true beware…
2024-12-06 12:53:03,"No, you lost your life savings because you thought this was a path to quick cash."
2024-12-06 12:53:46,Let me get this straight. People put their life savings in the hands of someone that became famous because she can supposedly suck good dick? I’m sorry but if you are stupid enough to get financial advice from her and believe it you deserve to loose your money. 
2024-12-06 12:54:16,This going to continue for as long as people let themselves get fleeced.  Trust no one.
2024-12-06 13:05:30,"Yeah, this is a case where it's ok to victim blame."
2024-12-06 13:05:46,This is one of those cases where I don’t feel bad for anyone involved. She sucks and the people who bought in on her scam were idiots who deserve to lose their life savings.
2024-12-06 13:07:24,"At some point you gotta think ""these people deserve to be get got"""
2024-12-06 13:07:54,I have no idea how people can get mad at her for this. Doesn’t she make more money this way?
2024-12-06 13:08:18,I don’t think it was Hailey that did the rug pull. I doubt she understands how it all works. I have a strong feeling her team is just using her and they screwed over her fans
2024-12-06 13:08:25,Maybe Don will appoint her economic advisor.
2024-12-06 13:09:24,Who would think the girl that likes to Hawk Tuah on that thing would make a good financial advisor or knows anything about crypto?  Just because you see the person on TV doesn't mean crap.  It's not like ... Wait ... These people elected Trump for President.  Nevermind.
2024-12-06 13:11:06,"What is she going to be jailed for exactly?  She offered a high-risk product (which has zero protection, regulations or government oversight).  They bought said product.  It decreased in value immediately (high-risk)."
2024-12-06 13:11:17,"""I am a huge fan of Hawk Tuah but you took my life savings,"" this belongs memorialized on a gravestone, holy shit"
2024-12-06 13:11:45,But but it was supposed to be the new bitcoin
2024-12-06 13:11:48,A fucking Unilad article. Am I on Facebook? Is it 2013?
2024-12-06 13:15:02,Some people have such a low iq. Why would investing based on a girl whose claim to fame is about spitting on the male member.
2024-12-06 13:15:16,I don't think she had any idea what the Paul brothers dragged her into.  She's the fall gal for the rug pull.
2024-12-06 13:18:46,Imagine you made some drunken comment to a YouTube nerd on a random night out and jump forward a year and your rich bitch! Merica we love you!
2024-12-06 13:19:06,A fool and their money...
2024-12-06 13:19:26,Tbis sort of stuff is what gives crypto a bad name
2024-12-06 13:20:46,"She'll have to "" Talk Tuah Judge."".... classic"
2024-12-06 13:20:51,If this is true then natural selection is working!
2024-12-06 13:22:04,Darwin? Like wtf you think is gonna happen? Oh you think it’s gonna go well? Yeah bad brain.
2024-12-06 13:24:49,I guess its okay to be greedy or stupid.  Better not be both. :)
2024-12-06 13:30:01,Should have known spit doesn’t flow up.
2024-12-06 13:31:58,https://youtu.be/zUHq8AWR1Rg?si=8X8U-5b9kJjH8Bft  Coffeezilla full video on the situation 14hrs 1.5mil views
2024-12-06 13:33:31,How do you even find the real one? You search HAWK on Coinbase and the list goes on and on and on and on and on and on….
2024-12-06 13:34:10,They should be mailed for buying a cryptocurrency from a girl who just got famous for spitting on dicks
2024-12-06 13:43:18,"This just shows me what we already knew. That’s fame ruins people. Tool a perfectly normal, seemingly sweet girl and turned her into a greedy narcissist in a matter of months. To even have the notion that “I should start a Hawk Tuah Cojn” is about as self absorbed as you can be. Absolutely foolish to put your money into something like this, but still, shame on her"
2024-12-06 13:49:46,That’s pretty low…she should have just sold nudes of herself like a decent person.
2024-12-06 13:50:38,Don't care. She's hot.
2024-12-06 13:50:53,The funny thing is that there are people in this post shitting on her who actually think Bitcoin is meaningfully different.
2024-12-06 13:51:34,they deserve it
2024-12-06 13:52:50,Next up: Hawk Tuah OF
2024-12-06 13:54:23,If people are still blowing their savings on crypto it’s their own fault. Let Darwinism do its job.
2024-12-06 13:54:51,"Don't worry, keep hodling, one day your BJ meme coin will make it to Coinbase."
2024-12-06 14:01:57,coin on sale now
2024-12-06 14:04:27,"I don’t know. I feel bad that they lost all the money. But,come on. We have to let them own the responsibility of being a dumbass and not seeing this person capitalizing on her new fame. The fact that she had fans from that clip, blows my mind. The fans then proceeded to make her rich by buying a meme coin. I thought that was a derogatory term for the cryptocurrency’s not something to buy in on. And if they had that much money to invest I would have hoped they made good choices to get that money and would know better. But that’s just my opinion."
2024-12-06 14:05:51,"If you lose your life savings thinking that Hawk Tuah coin is a good investment, part of me thinks you deserve to lose your money."
2024-12-06 14:06:45,"If you put your life savings towards Hawk Tuah girl's crypto, whatever happens to you is natural selection."
2024-12-06 14:06:52,Why would anybody spend money on this?
2024-12-06 14:07:05,I think I must be missing something. The thing that she's being accused of; it sounds like something that she's 100% percent allowed to do? I don't understand she could possibly be prosecuted for the crime of (checks note) selling things that she owns. Is it more complicated than that?
2024-12-06 14:08:05,"You really have to be very naive, greedy and stupid to put your life savings into this nonsense!  People never learn!"
2024-12-06 14:08:07,"If you lose your life’s savings over a bad investment from the Hawk, you have a serious gambling addiction."
2024-12-06 14:11:30,"If you invested your life savings in a Hawk Tuah cryptocurrency, i don't feel bad for you. I feel bad for everyone who has to live/work/interact with you"
2024-12-06 14:12:08,TBH not her fault theyre idiots
2024-12-06 14:14:33,Why should she be jailed? The idiots who bought this nonsense deserve everything they got from it. They're too stupid for life.
2024-12-06 14:14:46,"If there is one person that personifies everything that is wrong with modern society it's this girl and the situation that brought her to ""fame""."
2024-12-06 14:15:02,<the jokes write themselves>
2024-12-06 14:17:04,every meme has a coin now... how stupid are people who buy those?
2024-12-06 14:17:45,"If you bought her crypto currency, you deserve to be in jail."
2024-12-06 14:18:11,"I am happy for her.  I hope she legally did this.  She can sell whatever she wants, there is no hold on crypto.  Internet idiots don't understand why real investors don't buy crypto.  They ''hear'' all the time about crypto billionaires... where?  Where is the world riches people from Crypto?  They hiding?  They aren't.... the crypto thing is a scam now.  1 Currency has been well established, that is it.  Anything else is a pipe dream."
2024-12-06 14:23:15,"Was this article written by a 6 year old, or is it like halfway satire?  >> “I am a huge fan of Hawk Tuah but you took my life savings,” they penned to Haliey on the social media platform. “I purchased your coin $Hawk that you were so excited about with my life savings and children’s college education fund as well.”  Like this is just straight up regarded WSB material. It’s a joke, right? Right?"
2024-12-06 14:28:05,"I will ask for the rest of us, what is hawk tuah??"
2024-12-06 14:28:55,"If you buy crypto like this you deserve to be scammed cause people whining are only whining cause THEY didn’t get to profit.  If they did they’d be laughing at everyone else and not caring, so it really is just nonsense"
2024-12-06 14:31:33,"Why on earth would anyone put any amount of money, let alone their entire life’s savings, into a cryptocurrency created by Hawk Tuah girl?"
2024-12-06 14:33:31,Why would anyone buy a meme coin?    Sorry but you deserve to be scammed if you buy something like this
2024-12-06 14:38:05,The 1 that said they use their life savings and kid's college fund is a real moron.
2024-12-06 14:39:39,Never take financial advice from the same person you take blow job advice from. Enough said.
2024-12-06 14:40:12,She is starting an Only Fans page next.
2024-12-06 14:42:46,So we should buy the dip? 😇
2024-12-06 14:47:37,My question is why are we trying to crucify hawk tua instead of insider trading lawmakers? Why are we going after a meme rather than corporate sponsors of the state?
2024-12-06 14:49:18,"If you fall for these crypto rug pull scams you probably shouldn't be trusted with money at all. However, the people that do this crap need to face consequences"
2024-12-06 14:52:16,Lol come on just say “I took your money and you deserved to have your money taken for being so fucking stupid”
2024-12-06 14:53:00,So how much are people estimating that she made off of this?
2024-12-06 14:54:40,"Why did y'all make this bitch relevant in the first place? A bunch of men sexualized her into internet fame, and now they're mad because they listened, to HER? LOL, WUT?"
2024-12-06 14:54:42,"I think as a society we have moved past feeling sorry for people that buy Crypto of any sort, much less on the recommendations of a 15-minutes-of-fame celebrity."
2024-12-06 14:59:09,"This whole scenario is such a perfect metaphor for the shitshow that is modern culture.  It wraps up instant celebrity, monetization of 15 minutes of fame, greed, crypto, pod casting, and con-artistry into one neat bundle of dysfunction as the latest cool thing."
2024-12-06 14:59:21,Stupid games. Stupid prizes.
2024-12-06 15:00:05,Anyone who put money into this probably bets on the Washington Generals to win.
2024-12-06 15:00:28,"Why is she still relevant? She made a funny comment about sucking dick. That is all. She deserves all the attention of any other meme or viral videos but nothing more and frankly anyone who thought ""I bet that girl who likes spitting on penises can set up and run a successful cryptocurrency"" probably deserves to lose their money lol"
2024-12-06 15:01:57,"If you buy crypto based on what an influencer says, you are kind of asking for it."
2024-12-06 15:02:22,"There is something fundamentally wrong with the US if you can build and promote a pyramid scheme like this legally.   Ah sorry, I’ll take that back, it’s OK, it’s crypto. It’s the future of finance."
2024-12-06 15:03:43,Lol this was obviously going to happen. Most crypto now are rugpulls and scams.
2024-12-06 15:05:42,🤣 she worst than boogie and that’s saying a lot
2024-12-06 15:09:14,It’s not her fault people bought it
2024-12-06 15:14:18,You'd think she'd learn from everyone else but at the same time... She got famous for saying hawk tuah so should we be surprised?
2024-12-06 15:14:26,Anyone who lost their life savings to a phallus masticator shitcoin... deserves to.
2024-12-06 15:19:39,Almost time for Revolution
2024-12-06 15:20:32,betting your future on hawk tuah generating value is crazy 
2024-12-06 15:21:23,"Lololol, who the fuck is going to buy this woman's coin? Tell me you don't know anything about crypto without saying anything..."
2024-12-06 15:22:12,"Hilarious you sheep that bought in deserve it, fame worshippers"
2024-12-06 15:23:27,Can't wait for the in-depth Coffeezilla video 😅
2024-12-06 15:24:51,"You buy a shit coin then blame others when you get rugged...it's a lesson, learn don't cry."
2024-12-06 15:24:56,"If you invested your life savings in a crypto coin by a girl whose claim to fame is a funny answer to ""what gets men going in bed""... then I'm sorry, but you are an idiot."
2024-12-06 15:27:55,How many times does this have to happen for people not to invest in these shit coins? lol
2024-12-06 15:30:35,Not her fault. Buyer beware. Fools and their money are easily parted. Did anyone think this was a viable financial decision?
2024-12-06 15:33:09,"Wait a minute, why did people trust the financial acumen of a young lady that got her 15 minutes of fame by being recorded for saying she would spit on a dick while performing orally stimulated fellatio on a man while out drunk one night with her girlfriends subsequently losing her job as a teacher…. I could have sworn we all thought this was funny stupid?"
2024-12-06 15:33:11,"If you are stupid enough to buy a meme coin from anyone, especially an influencer that’s mildly famous for a blowjob joke, you don’t deserve your life savings."
2024-12-06 15:34:05,If you lost your lifesaving on this then you deserved it
2024-12-06 15:36:18,"So you ""invest"" in a ""virtual money"" supposedly created by a girl only famous for spitting on dicks and you're chocked when you don't get rich in return?  OK."
2024-12-06 15:36:47,Feels like 2022 again
2024-12-06 15:38:48,I guess it's not the pump and dump she was used to.
2024-12-06 15:42:25,Anyone savvy enough to buy this knew it’d be a rug pull
2024-12-06 15:43:22,WHAT?!?! Her investment advice wasn't good??!!  How could that possibly be???
2024-12-06 15:44:07,"Between this story and the CEO bandit, I feel like America truly is about to be great again... just don't fk up the next steps. You're *almost* there"
2024-12-06 15:44:54,There’s no way she wrote any part of this defence lol
2024-12-06 15:45:58,Where can i get a tshirt.if this crypto for free ;) love this shit
2024-12-06 15:47:08,You’re telling me people bet their life savings on something that’s not even tangible. Genius...
2024-12-06 15:47:58,"She is just garbage, not sure why she became so popular. There is nothing like being proud of the fact that you are white trash. This is exactly why crypto needs to be regulated. I was reading where someone said they bought 35k of this crap. How in the world did some moron think sinking 35k in a meme coin was going to be a good investment is beyond me."
2024-12-06 15:49:56,Shit coin
2024-12-06 15:50:29,"Maybe stop investing your ""life savings"" into every overly memed annoying influencer launching obvious garbage crypto."
2024-12-06 15:51:03,"Yea if you bought into that, you deserve that, use it for character development in finance."
2024-12-06 15:52:49,LMFAO. OH AND THEY ALL DESERVE IT!! absolutely sad fuck virgins made her famous cos she let slip she's slutty af. I'm laughing as hard as when all those mugs bought bath water 😂😂😂😂
2024-12-06 15:53:55,"I'm sorry to say, but if you're putting your life savings into Hak Tua girl crypto, then you probably shouldn't have the money. Like what are you thinking?"
2024-12-06 15:54:07,People who bought that are idiots.
2024-12-06 15:54:08,These are people that scream about the freemarket and smaller government.  What is their argument?
2024-12-06 15:55:38,"""So... it turns out the Hawk Tauh crypto meme coin was not a good investment.""  No Shit."
2024-12-06 15:56:53,Maybe Hawk Tuah Girl isn’t the best choice for a financial advisor. 🤷 I buy my cryptocurrency from Gorlock the Destroyer.
2024-12-06 15:56:59,"Oh my gosh, investing life saving in a damn memecoin... This is just unbelievable."
2024-12-06 16:02:18,Hawk Tuah Girl  And…  Cryptocurrency    What could possibly go wrong here??   *Some people are to ###p##to be allowed internet access*
2024-12-06 16:02:32,I don't understand how normal people can suddenly turn into scammers. I guess everything has a price.
2024-12-06 16:03:34,This is the dumbest fucking headline I have ever read in my entire life
2024-12-06 16:03:42,"imagine being this greedy, famous for nothing, was cashing already, but needed to be obscenely rich to be satisfied"
2024-12-06 16:04:05,stop making stupid people famous
2024-12-06 16:06:02,Seeing this makes me feel better about myself
2024-12-06 16:07:23,Wtf is she doing creating crypto
2024-12-06 16:11:18,I’ve started to see these things as just marketing. She’s back in the spotlight after it forgot her and when it forgets her again another thing will “happen”
2024-12-06 16:12:05,They deserved to get scammed for giving her money
2024-12-06 16:12:34, did she do the influencer speed run? What was here time from fame to crypto scam?
2024-12-06 16:17:36,Sorry... why does she have a cryptocurrency?

2024-12-06 16:27:48,The silver lining here is that the majority of people losing money are people who are hoping to be on top when everyone else gets rug pulled. They’re all scammers scamming each other

2024-12-06 17:15:40,Maybe some people hope to get a hawk tuah as a compensation
2024-12-06 17:16:09,💀

2024-12-06 17:17:38,"Oh my God, there's a hawk tua coin?"
2024-12-06 17:18:20,Investing everything into a currency with no oversight that is a known high risk is completely on the investor. Face it they were hoping to invest and quick sell so someone else would be holding the bag. Too bad they became the bag holders.
2024-12-06 17:22:53,Here’s an idea: don’t blow your life savings on speculative investments! 
2024-12-06 17:24:16,Rug pulah
2024-12-06 17:31:31,People are idiots.
2024-12-06 17:32:40,She ruined her life!
2024-12-06 17:33:05,Did she or her team sell it all after launching or did people buy it and sell it for quick profits?
2024-12-06 17:34:28,Investing in a shitcoin created by a girl whose sole claim to fame is making an oral sex reference didn’t work out?  Think of all the MBAs and PhD’s in Finance in utter shock
2024-12-06 17:40:27,Honestly.if you fall into meme coins expecting a payout its literally your own fault. Lol

2024-12-06 17:59:05,From the article  “The coin’s value completely tanked within 20 minutes of its launch - plummeting from as much as $490 million to just $41 million”  How does this shit coin still have a market value of $41 million? We truly are living in the stupidest era. These shit coin rug pulls makes someone buying tulips in the 1600s look like Warren Buffet.  I agree with a comment a read here. This girl might be president someday. It’s where we are as a country.

2024-12-06 18:10:38,I remember when she said something of the sort that she didn't want to be famous over this whole hawk tuah shit yet keeps doing everything in her power to be famous because of this hawk tuah shit.  Can we stop giving clout to this stupid woman already.
2024-12-06 18:13:47,Cypto not backed up by anything and the risk was a total lost in many cases.
2024-12-06 18:17:40,This isn’t Hawk Tuahs fault. If you lost money buying that you deserve what happened
2024-12-06 18:24:14,If you invested your life savings in Hawk Tuah coin you deserve to get rug pulled
2024-12-06 18:26:03,Losing your life savings to this is more embarrassing than that squid game token.

2024-12-06 20:03:13,"my questions is that, they claim her fans aren't even into crypto, yet how do you sell a crypto token to someone who has no knowledge of even buying or selling crypto.  You need to understand crypto even to know where to buy and store them.

2024-12-06 21:30:36,It should still be investigated regardless of poor decision making on the people who lost money.

2024-12-07 02:20:01,If you bought this girl’s crypto you deserve to get scammed. No one can force you to buy crypto and you made that choice. I’ve bought shit coins and lost money sure but I would never buy a coin from the fucking hawk tuah girl cmon now….

2024-12-07 10:50:27,I saw someone on X explain with on chain data how someone sniped the coin. They basically bought all the supply at open and dumped it on the market for 7+ figure win. Sucks for her if she had nothing to do with it which honestly seems more likely than not.

2024-12-07 15:04:34,I don’t feel sorry for these people who are “losing life saving”. Gee you invested in crypto which is sketchy on its own. In a company that is represented by someone  who’s only claim to fame is saying Hawk Tuah and probably financed by the scam brothers: Jake and Logan Paul. Sorry not sorry. Education can be expensive.

2024-12-07 21:59:30,I don’t understand.  If they bought the crypto and they still have it then they have technically lost nothing.  It’s as good as money isn’t it?  /s
2024-12-08 00:16:34,I really think we should all just stick to bitcoin lol.

2024-12-08 07:49:19,"Yeah she's kinda dumb. But at the end when she interrupted that guy and said she was going to bed .. that was very apathetic and dismissive. She should be culpable, just like everyone else."

2024-12-08 13:04:27,Some people have no concept of liquidity
2024-12-08 15:35:14," With Cryto and stocks the possibility exists that people could lose money. Any crypto associated with her would fall under meme coin territory which isnt the same as crypto imo. If someone decided to invest ""their life savings"" into a meme coin they clearly are foolish and didnt do any research and were not thinking at all.  No one made these people spend their money on this either. If they had gained money would they be complaining? If you cant lose the money or dont have at least basic education on these things you shouldnt be putting your lifes savings (i highly doubt there was this amount involved).  If he made this to scam people, that is a seperate issue. Meme coins are dodgy af. This isnt her fault and if anything Id blame the idiocy of whoever thought oh lets put my life savings into a thing related to a meme. Whoever did this is uneducated and let a viral internet trend and emotions and a sheep mentality be involved. This wasn't even investing. People always want a scape goat for their own stupid choices."

2024-12-05 21:39:56,"You invested in a crypto because a whore told you too, then get mad???"
2024-12-05 22:08:03,"Have none of these people ever seen how these stupid meme coins work before? It's a shame the FTC or some other government body isn't allowed to do strong regulation on these, but oh hey, people voted for a felon for president who loves cryptocurrency (because he sold all his for real money after bilking people out of their life savings), so these people are basically getting a really expensive lesson in FAFO."
2024-12-05 22:26:04,By that logic onlyfans prostitutes should also be jailed and casino owners
2024-12-05 23:03:47,I’m sorry but anybody dumb enough to put their life savings into a Hawk Tuah cryptocurrency does not deserve to walk free in society
2024-12-05 23:09:20,"When I read that 20% of all crypto has been stolen, I know I will never put a cent into it."
2024-12-06 01:39:11,"This is how you know crypto is a scam. As nice as I’m sure the hawk tuah girl probably is, even she’s got a crypto to shill. Why doesn’t she come out with a fragrance line instead? At least people can actually use it and smell good. Crypto annoys me. But I’m still considering buying some bitcoin lol"
2024-12-06 04:35:28,Its technically fraud and illegal but no one pursues these things.
2024-12-06 04:45:15,How did this woman get famous? Women that don’t swallow are pathetic.
2024-12-06 10:10:23,"Nope.   If you got scanned by this, you 100% deserve it. Hope there was a take away lesson."
2024-12-06 12:07:54,"She won’t go to jail, welcome to speculation trading."
2024-12-06 13:41:40,When is the government going to put protections in place for retail investors like every other financial investment???
2024-12-06 14:11:20,Oh boy! Another Ponzi Scheme!!!
2024-12-06 18:47:44,After the election I have zero empathy for idiots.   For the next 4 years…based on our decisions…I hope we get what we fucking deserve.
2024-12-06 19:22:47,She should be rewarded and those fools should have go around and explain to schools what they did like scared straight for crypto
2024-12-07 17:26:24,"If you put your life saving into this, you deserve to lose it."
2024-12-07 21:12:46,Big surprise a women scammed everyone out of there money
2024-12-08 01:53:16,How is this a scam? People bought a meme coin. How is anyone other than the regarded completely responsible
2024-12-08 04:11:26,These same dumb fucks probs highly invested in trump media
2024-12-08 06:12:30,I know there’s a lot of dumb people out there but I refuse to believe anyone with a life savings of note put it all into a crypto coin started by a person nobody had ever heard of 6 months ago.
2024-12-05 19:38:21,"It was a meme coin and you think she is responsible for your bad decisions? It's not like she scammed people, it lost value."
2024-12-05 22:17:10,Probably Jake Paul or which ever brother is financing her podcast.   I'm not naive in saying she didn't have a part cause she to some extent does.  But I won't be surprised if she was a scapegoat for the rug pull
2024-12-05 23:37:13,"They were in a Twitter space with coffeezilla (a youtuber who investigates these kinds of scams) where they said the rug pull happened due to snipers and it wasn't a scam cause they set up a ""foundation"" in the cayman islands that received the $1.8M from transaction fees of her meme coin instead of them, so they supposedly didn't make any money off of this whole thing.  But they refused to answer who owned said foundation and therefore the money and ultimately muted and then kicked coffeezilla from the Twitter space.   No scam going on here, eh?"
2024-12-05 21:41:23,"Mf were trusting in something called ""Hawkanomics""."
2024-12-06 01:09:48,"Coffeezilla’s live call with them was amazing bullshittery. Relentlessly asking who got paid, and they everything possible except for an actual answer."
2024-12-05 21:21:12,Pull on that thang?
2024-12-06 00:58:55,The exchange? They don't host coins they don't hold. Do you bitch at new IPO's that tank? Or stocks that get naked sold short? I hope so
2024-12-05 21:42:35,"Pull up a chart of any token first   Next, nearly any stock.   They -all- do this. This behavior is not “predictable” it is ubiquitous.  That wouldn’t make any interesting headline though."
2024-12-06 01:00:32,I lost it at hawkanomics 😂
2024-12-06 01:31:26,"lol the ""team signed"" wallets are effectively just burned, the non-signed team wallets that ""no one knows are the teams"" however..."
2024-12-06 03:16:09,"It was a presale with the tokenomics of all the presale ""investors"" funds unlocked on day 1.  So it launched and all the presale people started dumping. Something like $3.2M atm."
2024-12-06 12:45:03,"Coffeezilla was on a discord call they were denying everything….uh it came right out of the creator wallet guys, at least this might be the most transparent scam yet"
2024-12-06 13:03:03,"It's a shit coin with hype, people had fomo and are now stuck holding the bag, story old as time"
2024-12-06 13:41:37,Many pre release investors sold and there were no rules to say they couldn't.
2024-12-06 14:57:42,Coffee already had a video on this because he was in their Twitter space call. Basically they did a pre sale and that's who sold
2024-12-06 16:22:56,Not with their doxxed wallets atleast
2024-12-06 18:32:25,"It's what happens when you get mixed up with far righters and crypto Bros. It's why they want the consumer protection agencies that protect regular folks from scams and fraud to be dismantled.   Again, once you start allying yourself with far righters, being involved in crime and having your life ruined is inevitable. That is unless you are allied with putin himself and have enough money already to bribe the rest of the folks. You know who I'm talking about and he still committed crimes, and was convicted. He slithered his filthy ass out of convictions on most of them though."
2024-12-06 19:18:20,"It would certainly be interesting in a way as well to know where all the original coins came from then, since they would have a 100% ownership in the start no? And then sell to other investors and then tank it."
2024-12-06 21:06:38,Didn't she have mark Cuban on her podcast and asked for his wallet adress so she could give him some coins lol
2024-12-06 21:40:22,Nobody needs to rig it.  It is just the natural development curve when a useless thing is hyped up.
2024-12-09 18:41:42,Someone bought up 98% of the supply the second it launched. Could have been anyone especially if they knew the deployer address.

2024-12-05 20:03:41,Street interview ---> Podcast ---> Rugpull
2024-12-05 19:09:40,Any% glitchless

2024-12-05 19:28:27,For some reason I have a feeling the Paul brothers were involved in this somehow
2024-12-05 19:37:07,I wouldn't even call it a speed run. She just took her 15 minutes and maxed it out.
2024-12-05 19:19:10,She clearly understood the idea of 15 minutes of fame.  What a lady.  Killing it.  God bless America.
2024-12-05 19:12:12,"That’s what I just told my coworker this morning lmao, like she had it planned from the second she got interviewed"
2024-12-05 19:14:15,I bet her speedrun will be beaten by mid 2025
2024-12-05 19:28:07,She has actually made an impressive amount of good decisions following that viral video  This was not one of them tho.
2024-12-05 20:47:09,"Attention is the most valuable commodity today. Not the dollar, not gold and not crypto.   She's a very smart woman and capitalised on this opportunity extremely fast but all these mfs who upvote her, push engagement to her and comment need to be removed from the planet. They make her wealthier whilst their own lives crumble and they don't have the intelligence to stop.   This is general advice for anyone in the talentless industry.... Ie shitty dances, useless podcasts, ragebait entertainment, prank videos etc.   People should be giving their attention aka their time/life energy to people who actually deserve it... People that make documentaries, science experiments, biographies, history videos etc. Actual useful stuff."
2024-12-05 19:29:05,"Probably ""basically a nobody"" again in 5 years time."
2024-12-05 20:34:33,People literally talked about how it would be impossible for her to become famous off of one meme so much that it came full circle and made her famous. Then people talked about how stupid her crypto was so much that it came full circle and became a meme coin that actually got buyers. Now she'll probably seek legal counsel and people will make fun of her for it so much that she'll probably become an AG or some shit.
2024-12-05 19:23:33,☠️☠️☠️
2024-12-05 19:57:30,She's going to be President some day.
2024-12-05 20:15:41,Yes and her inexperience with fame is what led to this. Now I’m sure she’ll be spending the next several months wishing she never became famous.  Being famous is great when most people have a good/benign opinion of you.  Being famous is probably the worst thing in the world when most people hate you.  Imagine everywhere you go is just people scowling. Sounds terrible.
2024-12-05 20:30:02,Is it that much of a scam? Isn’t it just like any other meme-coin?
2024-12-05 20:30:54,I guess OF is the last step
2024-12-05 20:43:37,"The epitome of what's wrong with society, I hate everything about her 🙃"
2024-12-05 21:55:09,"It’s just taking the Trump boys —from Sr. on down — a little but longer but they have embarked down the same path.  See, World Liberty Financial."
2024-12-05 22:00:11,She was/is some porn actor no?
2024-12-05 22:15:25,You say crypto scam like you can have crypto with out a scam...
2024-12-06 00:50:35,Seriously. Way to milk that 15 minutes
2024-12-06 01:15:29,"She took the right wing shill path too early, most people get to squeeze out a decade of content before they make some big controversy and take the ""I can't be canceled by the woke left route"""
2024-12-06 01:46:20,She’s right in between Richard Grieco and Matt Damon
2024-12-06 03:51:24,Look who's top of the r/cc pops
2024-12-06 05:06:22,"Since her platform was backed by Logan Paul, the cryptoscam isn't even remotely surprising"

2024-12-06 06:19:17,I mean how long could she really milk a meme like that? Cashing out hard is the way to go there.
2024-12-06 06:29:29,yeah but didnt you see her that one time giving food to a dog?
2024-12-06 09:30:24,In the course of only 6 months.   Like.. what does that do to a person
2024-12-06 09:35:25,And probably set for life money wise
2024-12-05 19:30:13,>From basically a nobody to crypto scam  Her fame ended long ago tbh. One time she went up to festival stage and got the silence response...this was summer.
2024-12-05 19:27:52,Wonder how big the fight will be when she boxes Ronda Rousey
2024-12-05 19:55:19,She actually turned out to be real Hawwwk Tuaah
2024-12-05 19:57:27,I'm almost sorry that Bill Maher's creepy attempts to be her manager weren't realized. A whole different disaster could have awaited her that would have at least not affected others.

2024-12-05 22:22:37,"Honestly, she saw her 15 minutes of lemon fame, and made lemonade."
2024-12-05 22:29:25,"No hawk tuah, she went in dry this time"
2024-12-05 22:34:31,Yea I think she skipped a lot of of the fun stuff went straight for crypto scam
2024-12-05 22:43:55,She's the Milli Vanilli of dick sucking.
2024-12-05 22:45:44,It's amazing the things even an implied BJ can accomplish
2024-12-05 22:49:35,Level 2: Podcast  Level 3: Crypto Scam  Level 4: Child Predator
2024-12-05 23:02:42,Biggest idiots people who gave her the money what her financial back ground oh yeah she knows how to suck dick 🤔🤷‍♂️🤣
2024-12-05 23:11:42,She saw an opportunity to hustle and maxed it.
2024-12-05 23:21:44,"Yeah, what a scam, someone literally transfers money into Hawk Tua thinking they are going to make money?  It’s as much a scam as a lotto ticket.  Dum dums gonna dumb"
2024-12-05 23:35:25,Crypto scam any %
2024-12-05 23:51:13,"“Basically a nobody” not even basically, just literally a random on the street"
2024-12-05 23:51:47,Its likely a smart choice. Not saying if she did something illegal thats a good choice but rather that she likely isnt going to stay famous for long. So strike while its hot.
2024-12-05 23:57:37,You gotta spit on that thing
2024-12-05 23:57:55,Crypto scamming is probably on her contract.

2024-12-05 23:58:34,Ahhh yeah you gotta spit on that girl!
2024-12-06 00:00:57,now social media is pump and dump like shit coins
2024-12-06 00:04:47,the ultimate goal of every internet celebrity 🥰
2024-12-06 00:11:33,It happens a bit too often though
2024-12-06 00:25:52,This is gonna do virtually nothing to her career
2024-12-06 00:33:05,"Apparently, she has the 3rd largest podcast. After Joe Rogan, and I forget who is 2nd. Not 100% if that’s true."
2024-12-06 01:12:11,How can people still buy into these crypto schemes? Anyone doing that today had enough information to dig into if it’s a good idea
2024-12-06 01:37:38,Scam? Lmao. If you lost money on that you’re wholly liable for your own risks taken. That aint no scam.
2024-12-06 01:52:08,"What do you mean, basically a nobody? She was am absolute nobody."
2024-12-06 01:58:25,Pretty soon 15 minutes of fame will literally be 15 minutes
2024-12-06 02:02:19,"She’s involved w the Paul brothers. Of course she did this, crypto scams are their thing"
2024-12-06 02:03:21,"Strike while it’s hot , Is a 100 yr old saying for a reason."
2024-12-06 02:20:49,I’m in awe that there are stupid enough to throw life savings at her crypto. How did these people get to the point where they even had life savings to blow away?
2024-12-06 02:29:40,all in less than a year
2024-12-06 02:38:19,Fastest Hero to Villain I’ve ever seen.
2024-12-06 03:21:24,Was it actually a scam though?  Did she deliberately deceive people?  Normally when I think of crypto scams I think of people who mint NFTs promising the NFTs will be used in some sort of project that then is abandoned as soon as people buy in.
2024-12-06 04:06:56,How long did it take Leon to do this?
2024-12-06 04:36:40,"Mentioning ""scam"" with ""crypto"" is redundant"
2024-12-06 05:26:06,She has a top podcast. All the top Podcasters and Youtubers seem to do it.
2024-12-06 05:34:48,"Then retire from public life, and buy an island somewhere. It's the American dream."
2024-12-06 05:50:23,"A quickie, if you will..  It's like she spat on her fanbase...  Sounds like she really sucks...."
2024-12-06 06:41:57,Fingers crossed this will bring her faster to her true calling: pornography
2024-12-06 07:24:47,She rides her fame like a mechanical bull.
2024-12-06 07:42:25,Been like 6 months lmao
2024-12-06 07:51:37,full villain arc
2024-12-06 08:45:12,"She's the sort of internet celebrity I should normally dislike but she's so openly and unapologetically brazen about it, it's endearing. Like, she had a viral meme and just went for it."
2024-12-06 09:06:32,"From what I had seen she didn’t even have her social media active when she first blew up. At which point people around her told her she should take advantage of this. First impressions were that she seemed to be a nice person, one of the early things she did was a charity.   So I wouldn’t be surprised if this is atleast 70% management doing this, milking her. Can’t always blame 1 person when their entire life is thrown upside down, they don’t always know how to deal with all the leeches swarming. Or I am wrong and it was a facade."
2024-12-06 09:29:56,Waiting for the I am so sorry video with fake tears and hidden giggles.
2024-12-06 09:49:57,"maybe she'll speed run the whole cycle: health violations in branded food and sexual assualt, thhen fading into obscurity"
2024-12-06 10:24:51,"why would she even get involved with something like this? she should have just carried on with the podcast until it eventually fizzles out and she could have gone back to a normal life, but she had to make the dumbest influencer move of them all and go for the get-rich-quick crypto scam"
2024-12-06 11:09:12,She *really* put those 15 minutes to work.  I'm impressed too.
2024-12-06 11:11:24,"I am too. Millions have tried and most have failed. She’s killing it at hacking fame, and it starts to be consistent enough to call it skills. With the crypto she’s becom in g a legend"
2024-12-06 12:15:52,This is normal for her kind 🤷🏽‍♂️
2024-12-06 12:17:03,To be honest…  Who is that dumb to invest significant money in whatever she’s running….

A car pulls in to the left of me and this 40 year old dude who was dressed like an early 2000s fuck boy gets out of the car and walks towards the store.  As he's passing my open window, he turns around, and like an advertiser says:  BITCOIN  And then just goes into the store.   It was so weird."
2024-12-06 13:10:36,According to coffeezilla is some utterly deranged psycho
2024-12-05 19:08:13,Technically $200 can be someone's life savings.      Sensational headlines are the worst.

2024-12-05 20:11:42,Must be the same people who voted for Trump and bought his merch and stocks in his companies.
2024-12-05 20:14:19,Yes
2024-12-05 20:14:27,"It was CLEARLY an “establishing legal evidence” type post. The user had crypto type username. At this point, anybody who knows how to create a SOL wallet, load it up with 30k and buy a meme coin knows what they are doing. They know it as run pull. They are all just trying to be on the pull side and not the fall flat on your ass side. This dude may have lost money but he lost it trying to scam other people out of THEIR money."
2024-12-05 20:15:52,This is called survival skills. Something this person lacks.
2024-12-05 20:17:09,"Bro, people bought NFTs"
2024-12-05 20:23:05,"Bruh, we voted Trump back into office.  The answer is ""very fucking stupid"""
2024-12-05 20:23:43,Do you really have to ask that if you see who they are following?
2024-12-05 20:25:46,"This is being reported the same day at BTC hitting $100k… and people don’t realize *its the same thing.*  Difference being this was a quick rug-pull whereas BTC could wreck the economy and leave thousands (maybe millions?) holding the bag.

2024-12-05 20:26:25,Did I really read people bought her junk?
2024-12-05 20:29:35,This is America dude…. Trump was just re-elected. There are a lot of dipshits.
2024-12-05 20:30:55,The current state of the world makes more sense everyday
2024-12-05 20:43:33,"I'm gonna say there's a sliding scale between people who forget to close their quotations and people who get pumped and dumped by a chick who can't even describe a good blowjob, let alone give one."

2024-12-05 20:57:31,This is just modern Darwinism
2024-12-05 20:58:19,"However stupid you think they are, even stupider than that."
2024-12-05 20:59:47,"It's funny because the motivation behind both sides is greed. She wants to make money, and the people putting their money into the meme coin also want to make it rich.  So at the end of the day dumb hypocrites"
2024-12-05 21:00:38,"I was roomie with someone who got himself in debt taking out high interest-no security loans, then tried to gamble himself out of it by investing in high risk stocks like Bed Bath and Beyond, then tried to gamble himself out of that by investing in crypto, the tried to make back his losses by becoming a drug dealer despite being the whitest, most innocent guy you’ve ever heard of, then ran out of money due to being way too trusting and getting scammed out of hundreds of grams, so he went to real criminals and got himself thousands in debt to them, only to get busted by the police and losing everything. So then he quit his job to get a severance pay they were offering so he could pay back a part of the money he owed the criminals so they wouldn’t deal with him and now he works at a company repairing phones for $10 an hour but with provision making him able to earn “up to” 4k a month when in reality they don’t have the customer base so he spends most days sitting in an empty store without a single customer.   Some people are like worms in vinegar."

2024-12-05 21:06:31,Sadly that could mean 50 bucks for some people

2024-12-05 21:10:50,I think we answered just how stupid we are a little over a month ago.
2024-12-05 21:12:34,Why you asking that when they just elected trump back into office.
2024-12-05 21:12:38,There are some really dumb gullible fans out there.
2024-12-05 21:14:29,"This girl has made millions by saying she gives sloppy blow jobs, imagine what she could do with a few crypto genius’s helping her out? lol, the really answer is people are really fucking stupid."
2024-12-05 21:16:06,"People who bought that stupid coin deserve to lose everything. If you're dumb enough to buy into that shit, rip to your bank account"
2024-12-05 21:21:19,"Think about the dumbest person you know, then realize that’s at least 300 million people in the US alone that are that dumb."
2024-12-05 21:22:12,Full blown Idiocracy is where we're at now.
2024-12-05 21:23:31,Every one of those people would have lost their life savings on something else stupid if not this.

2024-12-05 20:09:29,I think you mean memecoin/shit coin. Let's not lump this in with some that might have some actual form of use or utility (which hawk has none).
2024-12-05 20:26:40,The tweet it’s quoting reads like a joke IMO
2024-12-05 20:29:56,Some slimeball who thought they'd get out before the rugpull
2024-12-05 20:41:38,the same morons that made her the next big thing when she shouldn't have been nothing but a vine
2024-12-05 19:02:14,Someone trying to get that Hawk Tuah being her most loyal dipshit 😂

2024-12-05 20:35:48,I dunno. A lot of us probably own even lamer SOL ecosystem meme coins. Cmon HEGE! And maybe HAROLD?
2024-12-05 20:45:17,💎🙌🦍
2024-12-05 21:43:31,But but she once made a slightly amusing joke about blow jobs so obviously I should put everything I own into whatever random investment scheme she cooks up!

2024-12-06 00:03:45,Doesn’t mean that stupid people deserve to be scammed 
2024-12-05 19:11:42,"Some of them made out quite noice once it first launched. If you held it for more than a week, eh, I dunno what to tell ya."
2024-12-05 19:09:33,There's a guy selling gold sneakers on the internet...
2024-12-05 22:24:12,Is it really a crime taking their money? They were just going to lose it on something else anyway.
2024-12-05 22:37:35,"It's not the most moronic thing in the world since it is crypto. It's obviously a scam, but if you guess the peak correctly you can be be the last person to step off the rug and give your place to someone new by selling right before they rip it out from under everyone's feet. Remember for everyone who bought in right before the crash, someone else got to sell at the very peak and make a mint. If you get in early and don't get greedy holding too long you can theoretically benefit from the scam without any of the potential legal repercussions."
2024-12-05 22:44:05,The same that do that with with DOGE coin??

2024-12-05 23:16:27,Just someone that thought it was going to be a meme stock like gamestop. Don’t feel bad for anyone that lost money on this obvious pump and dump that was trying to just get rich quick
2024-12-05 23:34:08,i want to believe that a lot of the people on social media saying that are just trolling but there’s def some idiots who fell for this
2024-12-05 23:36:39,"The same guy that would buy Bitcoin 10 years ago.  Remember, from the perspective of the average person, there is no difference between any crypto coin. It’s entirely luck whether or not you got extremely rich or lost it all."

This is sarcasm for the inept."
2024-12-06 11:24:22,The same people who bought NFTs when they were hyped up

2024-12-05 23:31:05,"Reminds me of the guy that bet [35,000 pounds on Undertaker beating Brock Lesnar](https://imgur.com/a/AgEJa) and lost.   If he won he would have won 500 pounds.  Maybe fake, but honestly there's a lot of suckers out there."
2024-12-05 23:43:56,sounds like he thought he was getting in at the beginning of a pump and dump and he didnt realize it was going to be this fast and he's pissed...
2024-12-05 23:50:45,No hawk tuah for him!
2024-12-05 23:53:40,This is the same type of guy who proposes to strippers. “I thought I MEANT SOMETHING TO YOU!?!?!”
2024-12-06 00:06:26,He forgot to spit on it first.
2024-12-06 00:09:37,It’s on the internet so it must be true.

2024-12-06 00:31:10,It doesn’t make her less scum though
2024-12-06 00:34:44,Huge fan?!?  Of what? Lol.
2024-12-06 00:38:43,“I’m a huge fan of Hawk Tuah” is such a funny statement. Better let someone spit on that thang before making these kind of financial decisions.
2024-12-06 00:42:56,deserved
2024-12-06 00:44:13,“Huge fan” lmfao. Of a girl that made a stupid blow job joke?
2024-12-06 00:49:31,"Definitely fake, the same tweet was posted here like yesterday but it was a lady saying it"
2024-12-06 01:12:46,> I am a huge fan of Hawk Tuah but  Wtf is there to be a fan of?? Am I missing something?

2024-12-06 06:48:16,That has to be satire
2024-12-06 07:19:19,I mean it’s kind of the point with memecoins right? Get in early and try to predict when the rugpull happens and get out fast? These people gambled expecting to make less savvy people hold the bag and lost. It’s what they wanted just the wrong role.
2024-12-06 08:28:32,If he didn't lose it that way he probably would have lost it to a Nigerian Prince anyway. Assuming that's true...
2024-12-06 09:35:16,I don’t buy it…you’re financially savvy enough to start a college fund but not enough to avoid buying cryptocurrency from a teenage girl who got famous for miming a sloppy blowjob?
2024-12-06 10:22:24,This can’t be real

2024-12-06 16:10:24,likely this is a guy who thought if he got in early he would be a part of the people who benefitted after the rug got pulled BUT he didn't understand how that works.
2024-12-05 19:05:43,"Not a fake story if it was a crypto 'rug pull'. I'm not sure if this was. I haven't researched it, but it kinda sounds like it. Look up 'crypto rug pull'."

Then realize a whole lotta people in the world are walking around making those same mistakes without being under any influence at all.

2024-12-05 22:38:56,He will probably cover it on his second channel. This ain't an elaborate multi month/ year scam like SafeMoon or Traders domain to have main channel video.This is just another dogshit celebrity doing an exceptionally predictable rug with idiots still falling for it.
2024-12-06 00:29:44,Out now. Just a heads up

2024-12-05 19:13:22,"I feel like people were sort of giving her a lot of grace too. Almost like “yeah, you’re now rich and famous for an absolutely stupid reason, but hey, you seem nice and normal and are doing good things with the money.”  Nope, all of that good will burned to the ground in an instant. Send her back to obscurity."
2024-12-05 19:25:49,I honestly think she got approached by someone like the Paul brothers who were like “you can do this and it will make you even more cool and you will have your own coin which is a brand. You will be able to do so much with it!”And they just used her actual brand to rug everyone and leave her holding the garbage bags full of angry investors.  I cannot see her masterminding this or even understanding what was happening.
2024-12-05 19:10:57,"She's had a fame speedrun that 99.9999999% of people will never see in their entire lifetimes (hell, 99% of currently famous people took longer than 6 months to go from nothing to front page news) and all she had to do was not get into crypto scamming."
2024-12-05 19:04:43,Fr. She fumbled it big time.
2024-12-05 20:19:27,She isn’t smart enough to really know how crypto works.  Looking forward to the coffeezilla video!
2024-12-05 20:28:15,I dont think shes smart enough to pull off a rugpull. Sounds like she trusted the wrong people.
2024-12-05 20:41:24,"It sounds like she is probably being led by some ""managers"" that are ""helping"" with her success. They sound like they are running her ass ragged.       Unfortunately, like most who rocket into popularity, she will eventually be eaten up and spit out."

2024-12-06 00:36:33,"People who don't understand what this is. Most of her fans aren't interested in crypto or whatever. They probably heard about bitcoin hitting 100k and though, damn that's cool. I'll go in on that. It's always easy to judge and laugh, but the majority of people aren't informed about crypto and the scams in that world. It's not ok to profit of someone's ignorance.   That's why governments have things set up to protect the consumer in many other cases. And there should be more repercussions in the crypto world, too.   I'm not saying the people who bought this aren't at fault. But they lied. They talked about how great this will be and rug pulled. If you went to a casino, and it turned out the cards at your black Jack table were rigged, that would be illegal. "
2024-12-06 03:29:27,"Majority of buyers were looking to buy with the hype bubble growing and sell it for a profit almost instantly. Its ridiculous to even consider it. But buying doge at 5 cents right after its launch made people a quick buck when it hopped to 40. Its a treat to laugh at it. Dont by crypto from the #1 dix spitter on tiktok, folks. "
2024-12-06 08:36:47,Well. It's a bit like dogecoin which is also a meme. Except it hasn't the richest man on the planet behind it to support it sometimes.  Anyone who puts their lifesavings in dogecoin has nobody to blame but themselves if they loose a lot of money/everything. Same with this.
2024-12-06 12:44:52,"Nobody. And I know I'm an outsider from r/all but do people actually believe to be able to pay for day-to-day stuff with any of these online coins? Maybe, maybe bitcoin after Trump links it to the US but that is the only one. All these small coins are either rugpulls waiting to happen at worst or fun side entertainment at best.

2024-12-06 09:48:18,Not to be extremely cautious?
2024-12-05 19:03:21,This would never make it to an exchange.  You swap directly from liquidity pools for this tier of shitcoin

2024-12-06 02:27:06,Given the nature of crypto the fact that they still do this is even more revealing about how bad these coins are.
2024-12-05 19:08:35,"It's literally thousands of people who all think they can dump within a few seconds. They don't understand the spread at all with their limit orders.  Everyone is liquidating almost instantly at launch because they think they will win. Almost everyone loses. Milliseconds, internet speed, and the order book is the difference between a handful of winners and thousands of losers."

2024-12-06 00:24:34,"1. Hawk tuah girl is a meme made by timanddeetv. The video originally is a street interview and interview a girl who responded in a southwestern accent which have revealed it was Haliey Welch which she made Talk Tuah Podcast.   https://amp.knowyourmeme.com/memes/hawk-tuah-girl  2. They think it’s a fast money move to buy crypto from a famous person. They think they can potentially ape that coin to profit a lot.  3. If I remember correctly, before the launch, they did a pre-launch which allows people buy coins or to get it from the developers. When it launches somehow the token chart pumped a lot making people want to sell the token but it got locked and it dumped. In a result according to bubblemaps twitter page, it’s actually been reported that the wallet are holding 90% (if I remember correctly, it’s the investor, team members, etc that withdrew from their wallets) that controls the coin that would dump.   Comment me if I am wrong  Edit: saw an article that talks more about the coin https://www.cryptotimes.io/2024/12/05/hawk-tuah-girls-hawk-memecoin-dumps-90-faces-backlash/"
2024-12-06 00:29:14,Someone else did I believe. She has a team that made it

2024-12-05 22:17:08,"Most stocks don't drop all the way because they still provide a dividend for holding, they're worth at least as much as what you expect to get paid out of the company profits. If I think I'm going to make $10 just from the annual dividend, then it makes sense to buy every single share on the market below $10, because I think I'll make my money back on all of them and then either sell for a profit or keep holding for the next dividend. The only time it goes to zero is when the company isn't expected, by anyone, to actually make money ever again. And bonds pay a specific rate of interest that, unless the issuer goes under like with stocks, means it's always worth something as well.   Holding crypto has no inherent return.  It can appreciate, like any other asset, but you have to sell it in order to realize those gains. There is no price floor, every single one of them could become impossible to sell, and thus actually worthless, and there's no surefire way to know before that happens."

2024-12-05 23:32:53,"Id also bet they spun up her fame. Some old video, been watched by a lot of people ""resurfaces"" and some how is virally published probably courtesy of Paul brothers phone farm and then boom, come  get this crypto pyramid scheme we got going on."
2024-12-05 23:34:20,"Don’t worry, the federal agencies in charge of protecting consumers will be able to investigate the matter…oh, wait."
2024-12-05 23:45:58,100% they convinced her to do this “oh people won’t hate you That much look at us we still and fans and you’ll make a shit ton of money” getting a new icon to do it was the only way they were going to be able to do it again
2024-12-05 23:53:47,"For sure, she's just the face, I don't believe for a second that she came up with this scheme."
2024-12-06 00:10:53,Fuck those guys
2024-12-06 00:14:48,"Yeah people have been calling her smart, but all that really happened is she got invited to the club."
2024-12-06 00:17:18,Cryptozoo anyone?
2024-12-06 00:30:07,The ring girl is their new image
2024-12-06 00:57:12,"They are. I've mentioned this in other threads, andnit's going on deaf ears"
2024-12-06 01:25:32,They probably used her to put attention on her rather than Logan
2024-12-06 01:30:40,Guarantee she is being scammed as well
2024-12-06 01:31:06,Makes sense. She wasnt going to last long anyway. Leave to the Pauls suck a bunch of profits while ruining thier future at the same time
2024-12-06 01:41:59,UnitedHealth public treatment?
2024-12-06 01:42:57,"Oh great, yet another reason to hate them lol"
2024-12-06 02:07:17,I mean they have experience doing it
2024-12-06 02:09:45,It might explain why she went viral.....
2024-12-06 02:15:24,Oh yeah? When is she gonna box Gina Carano?
2024-12-06 02:16:21,Can't stand them buns 1 bit! They are complete trash
2024-12-06 02:20:28,"That actually makes so much sense. They harvested her for what’s she’s worth. Say what you will, Paul brothers are pieces of shot but they’re sneaky af."
2024-12-06 02:22:56,> The Paul brothers own her company that produces her or whatever and id bet a lot they’re behind this shit  Wonder if they also run a PR firm that always posts comments on Reddit about how much of a good person she is.
2024-12-06 02:57:28,People got used to not trusting it when their name and face is affiliated so just move scheme to new internet famous people. The Costco family is going to get used like a cheap lady of the evening to push some shit coin in enough time.
2024-12-06 02:59:48,Maybe have her fight Tyson for it then?
2024-12-06 03:23:24,The odds that she did this vs the odds that cryptochad thieves set her up …
2024-12-06 03:42:10,"Says a lot about her character if that's who she decided to work with, anyone who purchased their hawk coin should've done their homework on them too"
2024-12-06 03:49:10,bet.  no chance this was her idea.
2024-12-06 03:58:50,Grifters gonna grift.
2024-12-06 04:01:53,See this makes sense 💯
2024-12-06 04:03:31,They done pulled a Paul Brothers special!
2024-12-06 04:14:24,They're under investing for another crypto pump and dump scam.
2024-12-06 04:15:21,"Considering Logan had his own crypto scam, I wouldn’t be surprised."
2024-12-06 05:04:45,I watched her on Steve-O’s podcast and it was clear as day she didn’t have a full understanding of the business moves being made. She had to continually look at/ask her manager what was going next. Girl seems very sweet and it’s hard for me to believe this scam wasn’t orchestrated by someone else.
2024-12-06 05:09:40,Really? That is all that needs to be said. Sad they ruined that poor girls name and image….. 🤣
2024-12-06 05:13:44,"Funny, they were just involved with a huge fraud scheme of their own...."
2024-12-06 05:15:39,"Yep. I guarantee she had no involving other than signing something that said they could use here name on it.   I actually kind of feel bad for her. She seems like a nice enough kid with a big heart but the people who are basically controlling every aspect of her life  is are going to destroy it. Within a couple of years she’ll be broke, homeless and have to start an OF just to make ends meet"
2024-12-06 06:17:40,"How much of your life savings would you be willing to bet on your assumption?   Also, if I cover the bet, can I pay you in Hawk Tuah Crypto???"
2024-12-06 06:52:52,THIS. Logan had cryptozoo which turned out to be a scam and now they're sponsoring her who just so happens to be delving into crypto...
2024-12-06 08:34:19,ooooooooooooooh that's why. That makes complete sense now
2024-12-06 11:09:29,"On a side note, anyone remember the Fine brothers?"
2024-12-06 12:38:03,"Rug pulls are immoral and I wouldn’t run one. (Although maybe in some hypothetical world where everyone’s losses were capped at $10 and I made a couple million; it’s more of a $10 donation so I can stop working). BUT, what is the use case for the hawk tuah girls coin? Like why would you dump 35k into HER COIN. I understand putting a few bucks as a joke, but if you’re dumping 35k into it you are hoping you can jump out at the top with a ton of money and leave someone else holding the bag."
2024-12-06 14:05:06,And maybe the law will finally intervene?
2024-12-06 14:36:51,It was astroturf from the get-go.
2024-12-06 15:01:46,"If it smells, it's probably the Paul brothers."
2024-12-05 22:10:07,"dont defend her, she knew she was scamming her audience, she has no morals"
2024-12-05 20:05:26,Anchorman vibes... hard to be angry when she's achieved a certain level of notability with no actual abilities or skills to do so.
2024-12-05 21:32:48,A tale as old as time

2024-12-05 19:18:15,Underrated comment.  Well done.
2024-12-05 19:19:44,"Nay, talk tuah judge"
2024-12-05 19:36:38,Brilliant answer!
2024-12-05 19:41:47,yes I saw that pun on x community notes featured by moist critical also
2024-12-05 23:53:34,thanks ferris
2024-12-05 20:17:30,Become Orange. It’s the grift that keeps on grifting.
2024-12-05 23:39:19,I bet that’s exactly what she was told. You could literally watch the hype machine spring into action. I can’t believe crypto became an idea but that just goes to show what shitcoins really are
2024-12-06 03:37:59,She's had way more than 15 minutes at this point
2024-12-06 03:41:01,Andy Warhol was a prophet
2024-12-06 10:05:06,SAVE FERRIS
2024-12-05 22:07:11,She literally just interviewed mark cuban and wiz. Girl is a millionaire with one of the most listened to podcasts on the planet. Way past 15 minutes of fame 
2024-12-05 20:52:39,She’s also really good looking
2024-12-05 21:56:38,They own the company that promotes her
2024-12-05 20:53:57,Honestly the modern American dream
2024-12-06 00:22:25,I can't even be mad. She literally got her little bit of fame for talking about sloppy top one time and ran with it. If somebody tomorrow told me I could do the same thing then we would have hawk tuah 2: electric boogaloo.
2024-12-06 03:38:42,"We need to stop using the 15 minutes thing with her, she's had at least an hour by this point"
2024-12-06 05:04:55,Who said her fame ended? She's still famous.
2024-12-06 11:41:18,"> 15 minute  Remember when she was using her 15 minutes of fame to make some donations to animal shelters and everyone was just so happy with her and talking about how great she was?  And then she signed with the Paul brothers and got paid.  Honestly, I can hardly blame her.  If I somehow became a viral sensation that clearly had a stupidly short shelf life, I'd be milking it for every penny I could get while I could get it.  A few smart plays during your 15 minutes can set you up for life.  Seriously, with ""only"" $10 million, earning a 6-7% annual return you can easily live off of 3-4% withdrawls (starting at $300k-$400k per year) for the rest of your life.  That isn't ""baller-level"" rich, but it is a very comfortable, upper-middle class standard of living in most parts of the United States.  And maybe I'm a cynic, but nobody is making money in crypto from new tokens except the scammers who create them and the exchanges who charge fees for trades.  Anyone who invests in those shitcoins probably deserves to lose it."
2024-12-05 20:42:22,There will be a Netflix movie about her one day
2024-12-05 23:09:11,Prior to her knowledge of marketing and promotion she had been working as a blowjob instructor at Jim’s Smoke and Stroke.
2024-12-06 00:33:35,"It’s hard to feel bad for people dumb enough to put their life savings in this. I got scammed before and at the end the finger is pointed at me, greed makes you stupid and some of learn the hard way"
2024-12-06 02:15:16,"Frankly, I think she did this country a great service."
2024-12-06 09:12:40,"This is just American culture at this point. When your president does crypto rugpulls and people vote for him. And then does another pump and dump money washing scheme on the stock market, and people still fall for it.. yeah..  This is America"
2024-12-06 12:14:22,Only second to cash me outside girl for making a bag out of it
2024-12-05 23:30:47,I adore her
2024-12-05 19:58:23,That she didn't want to even participate in.
2024-12-05 20:16:18,> This was not one of them tho.  Why not? Doesnt sound like she lost *her* life savings.
2024-12-05 22:41:02,"3400 updooted my comment... time to capitalize! /s  You're right though, something something bad publicity = tendies for life."
2024-12-05 20:22:00,"Being lower middle class in Canada, most people I see on the daily are scowling anyway lol"
2024-12-05 22:38:53,Rug pulls a rug pull. It's just been oddly normalized by lack of actual consequences in most cases.
2024-12-05 22:39:35,Personally I woulda done that first to expand the crypto rug pull audience but that's just me.
2024-12-05 22:43:52,I'm starting to believe it more and more every day
2024-12-06 05:00:17,"Oh hey gma, I'm not sure how I got here. Perhaps you can guide me back home."
2024-12-05 19:52:15,Weird how her podcast is still one of the most listened to in the world then
2024-12-05 19:46:51,Still more interesting than Tyson vs Jake
2024-12-06 01:15:04,On the venn diagram of ignorance there are still millions of people in the 'doesn't know anything about crypto' and 'celebrities are to be idolized' crossover category. It only takes a few hundred or thousand followers to pull this sort of thing off and celebrities have insane social reach.
2024-12-05 19:32:38,"Or it could be their life savings…  “One person took to Twitter to claim that they’d bought $35,000 worth of coin, but it to be worth just $2,000 ten minutes later. ‘I am a huge fan of Hawk Tuah but you took my life savings,’ they penned to Haliey on the social media platform. ‘I purchased your coin $Hawk that you were so excited about with my life savings and children’s college education fund as well.’”"
2024-12-05 19:35:52,Seen on twitter this guy put in 20k. What a dumbass
2024-12-05 19:13:03,And we all know every crypto investor has a max life savings of $200
2024-12-05 19:29:28,"The article says someone purchased $35,000. That's life savings for a lot of people."
2024-12-05 19:11:15,"""Journalism"" they call it"
2024-12-05 19:22:58,In the article there was a citation to someone who put 35k and after 10 min he had 2k. 35k in my opinion is actually life savings
2024-12-05 23:38:14,theres a legitimate chance that $200 is the mean life savings of all redditors
2024-12-05 19:37:51,Everyone needs to understand that there is a certain level of accountability when it comes to this stuff.
2024-12-06 04:29:43,I remember being super concerned for a high school girlfriend when she called saying she was in an accident and totaled her car… she got rear ended in a parking lot and broke a tail light.   It was not a nice car.
2024-12-05 19:28:38,Still speaks to the point that people are often uninformed and misguided
2024-12-05 19:29:09,The article says that someone on Twitter claimed they invested $35k to have it turn into $2k.
2024-12-05 19:33:36,"But people are also stupid, someone could have put millions into it"
2024-12-05 19:35:25,Someone shared the dudes reply the other day it was 35K
2024-12-05 19:39:24,i mean i red an article today about how someone lost 80 grand...so...yea
2024-12-05 19:43:23,"There are plenty of people who lost A LOT more than that, as a matter of public record."
2024-12-05 19:43:49,The guy in the article invested $35000 🤦🏻‍♂️
2024-12-05 19:45:38,"Well, this isn’t one of those headlines…   https://imgur.com/a/jO1lFjW"
2024-12-05 19:50:20,"Saw a post where a guy put 35k into her coin, was his savings and his kids college funds"
2024-12-05 19:51:01,The article said something about someone putting 35k in. Which... just... why???
2024-12-05 19:52:01,$200 hahaha like I’m some Rockefeller or something.
2024-12-05 19:55:07,The article mentioned one oerson turning $35k to $2k. Saying it was their life savings and kids college fund. Who is buying this??
2024-12-05 20:01:39,I mean the person in question said it was 35000. so it wasn't that sensational
2024-12-05 20:02:12,"In fairness, the headline is based on a viral reply that did explicitly state that they'd put their entire life savings and their children's college funds into the Hawk Tuah coin."
2024-12-05 20:09:02,"If you believe it, [this person](https://bsky.app/profile/peltzmadeline.bsky.social/post/3lcjlhj7h4s22) is claiming to have lost $35,000 which includes her kids’ college fund."
2024-12-05 20:10:19,"And if they put that $200 into this coin, yeah, they're stupid."
2024-12-05 20:12:35,If that's all you've got you still shouldn't be throwing it all in shitcoins
2024-12-05 20:14:07,It was $35k
2024-12-05 20:15:06,"If your life savings are low, you shouldn’t be in crypto. Most folks shouldn’t be in crypto in any significant way. It’s very volatile and you’re better off investing the same in ETFs."
2024-12-05 20:16:31,Someone with $200 as life savings shouldn't be gambling it around like this
2024-12-05 20:26:23,60% of the US population has less than $1000 in the bank.
2024-12-05 20:26:57,"it's more common than you think, too. Once you step out of the west $200 is a lot of money"
2024-12-05 20:50:50,"$35,000 is not a small amount.  If you wanna be the voice of reason, then get your shit together first.  Redditors like you are the worst."
2024-12-05 20:57:25,I’d bet it’s mostly people memeing saying they lost their life savings on HawkTuah coin.   Side note: she and the company that created the coin held a twittter spaces last night and coffeezilla ripped into them
2024-12-05 21:00:46,"I mean there was almost $500m lost, so while you may be right people got rugged for lots of money."
2024-12-05 21:02:54,And reporters using trolls as examples creates a false reality
2024-12-05 21:09:16,Sensational is unilad's bread and butter
2024-12-05 21:20:56,"People that don't read the articles, but still comment are the worst."
2024-12-05 21:31:14,"$200, those people are rich as fuck"
2024-12-05 21:31:50,"Also, crypto meme coins are the only form of gambling where people feel entitled to sue when they lose everything."
2024-12-05 21:35:34,Same principle. If that's your last $200 and you put it into a meme coin you're dumb as rocks.
2024-12-05 21:40:30,id love to double my life savings to 200
2024-12-05 21:45:03,"My life savings is the $75 that floats back and forth between my checking and ""savings"" accounts so I don't get charged a monthly fee for the privilege of having the bank use my identity for their quarterly financial scams."
2024-12-05 22:08:46,I do believe that dude bought $35k worth though…
2024-12-05 22:33:09,At least one dude lost over 30k...
2024-12-05 22:39:10,At least it's not -$200
2024-12-05 22:41:13,Reminds me of the tale of Henry Gribbohm:   [https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/nh-man-loses-life-savings-on-carnival-game/](https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/nh-man-loses-life-savings-on-carnival-game/)
2024-12-05 22:54:39,"Sure. But if $200 is your life savings, putting it all into an upstart meme cryptocurrency is really fucking stupid."
2024-12-05 23:35:56,The stats on this are mind-boggling in the US.
2024-12-05 23:36:10,Or you could just read the article and realize that they’re talking about exponentially more than $200. Idk just freeballin here
2024-12-05 23:37:31,"You don't go out much, do you?"
2024-12-05 23:38:32,So you do nothing besides read the headline lol
2024-12-05 23:47:49,"Who told you how much was in my life savings account!? Well jokes on you, I’m gonna be rich when those $200 USDs of Hawk Tuah coins turns into 2 Trillion 😎   /s"
2024-12-05 23:47:56,"After seeing something about some guy in China dropping [$550,000](https://www.thestar.com.my/aseanplus/aseanplus-news/2024/11/29/man-in-china-obsessed-with-kol-spends-us550000-on-gifts-hopes-she-will-call-him-brother) for a streamer to call him ""brother"" in chat I tend to think this might also be true."
2024-12-05 23:48:30,Alliteration is literally the worst thing ever.
2024-12-06 00:00:42,"Technically -$2,000 on a credit card can also be someone’s life savings."
2024-12-06 00:07:30,60% of Americans have less than 1k in savings.
2024-12-06 00:09:54,"Surely it doesn’t matter the quantity, putting your life savings into a cryptocurrency is a scrub move"
2024-12-06 00:19:43,"35,000 for some, so not really"
2024-12-06 00:26:26,Someone says they turned 35k into 2k over night.    Why would you spend that much on meme coins?
2024-12-06 00:29:10,"Whether your life savings are $200 or $200,000 you have to be pretty dumb to put it all into such a volatile market."
2024-12-06 00:43:43,The article is right there.
2024-12-06 01:05:51,There are reports of a 35k buy down to 2k and a 1.5m buy down to like 40k
2024-12-06 01:35:34,"But are we denying that people have absolutely dumped their entire life savings because a popular influencer talked up cryptocurrency to be the new form of currency and that the US dollar will crash before you know it and investing in ""bitchcoin"" will save you from the disaster of the dollar collapsing?"
2024-12-06 01:53:55,In Crypto it usually means tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars. This has been happening for years and years  You should check out Coffeezilla's YouTube channel. There are real victims losing insane amounts of money. I'm not saying they're smart people but there are def thousands of cases where people lose a metric shit ton of money to these scams
2024-12-06 01:56:46,Except people did actually lose their life savings. It wasn’t no $200. Tens of thousands
2024-12-06 02:27:40,"Yeah I don’t think people realize just how poor the average american is. I feel Sad For people in the situation you’re describing, and simultaneously very grateful that I’m blessed enough not to be there myself."
2024-12-06 02:36:35,A fool and his/her money are soon parted.
2024-12-06 03:04:50,Clearly you didn’t read the article
2024-12-06 03:54:20,Why you gotta put me on the spot like that
2024-12-06 04:44:13,That 200 may not seem like alot but that is the difference between eating and not. And if you are desperate you might fall for a crypto scam like this in hopes of getting out of the cycle of poverty.

Not really a hobbies of the intelligencia.  Shit they even put their national anthem at the beginning of doing their one hobby to make it even MORE american.  Could you imaine if all entertainment was so stupid you had to add the national anthem at the beginining?  Imagine people freaking out if the latest Quinton Terrantino didn't have the national anthem at the beginning?  Same.  Fucking super dumb people.

2024-12-06 00:58:26,"I hate when people say this. First of all, it’s untrue. The average Americans reading level is 7th-8th grade (https://www.crossrivertherapy.com/research/literacy-statistics). Now that may sound crazy since there are 12 grade levels, right? But this is actually pretty in line with other Western countries. For example, in the UK and Scotland the average reading level is age 9, which would be 3rd grade (https://servicemanual.gov.scot/creating-content/readability).  I also dislike it because reading isn’t the only subject that makes up an individuals intelligence. It’s just people parroting some dumb shock quote they read/heard years ago.   Americans average IQ is right about 98, which means we rank just below average for countries IQs, which is 99 point something. We’re not all a bunch of idiots lol."

From there is a sliding scale of improvement, with only about 10% being able to read at a university level.   I used to work in a marketing related field (more on the data side) and used to wonder how we were able to influence buyer behaviour so easily. This answered most of my confusion.    I think my skills are better put to use in the political arena."

If the government becomes liable to prosecute people, then why not make it so the government regulates crypto, and suddenly we're back to square one.  This is the market in action. People need to learn hard lessons about investing in crypto. I mean us older crypto enthusiasts could educate new people about rug pulls rather than bombarding them with the sales pitch from time to time.  But that would hurt our bottom line as that would create FUD.   It's better to just let the morons lose their life savings rather than dragging the government into this or strongly advocate for prudent investment decisions."

2024-12-05 19:21:07,"By all accounts she was actually a good podcaster as well. She had a bright future ahead of her if she just played it moderately okay. But instead she was just like ""OMG I've got influence and respect, I'm gonna rob so many people..."""
2024-12-05 20:08:26,"feels like just a couple weeks ago news of her podcast hit the front page of Reddit and everyone was raving about it and applauding her for her “business acumen”. Not even bothering to mention that she was a Logan Paul plant. Well now she’s doing Logan Paul things, what a shock. "
2024-12-06 00:10:13,"wealthy, wealthy obscurity  what a fool she is!"
2024-12-05 19:41:06,"Whoever gets in first and immediately bails takes the money from everyone else who put a cent on later.  > According to aggregated data from Bubblemaps and Dexscreener, a mix of insider wallets and snipers — entities that rapidly buy up huge amounts of a token’s supply at launch — controlled between 80%-90% of HAWK’s supply at launch.  Tale as old as time"
2024-12-05 19:32:50,This 100% is not on her lol. She’s the face of the scam someone used her for. It’s just a matter of time before it’s revealed who got her into this.
2024-12-05 22:16:45,"stop simping, u think this bitch didn't know what she was doing? there is a reason she scammed her audience using crypto cos her lawyers told her is not regulated = no jail, cos she knew se was stealing. she chose to be associated to those paul bastards, no one put her a gun to her head. she's not a child, she's quite wealthy due to her cunning, not because she's mother theresa"
2024-12-05 20:34:20,"It's a direct result from how the cryptospace reacts on fresh memes. There were hawktuah coins like the moment the meme went viral, and of course a lot of approaches by these ""projects"" to get her attention. I can imagine that planted a seed she surely is not equipped to manage well, due to lack of experience. Not want to apologize her unprofessionality, but this is how it goes nowadays..."
2024-12-06 00:22:29,"We're way past ""I didn't know"" being a valid excuse for rugpulls, too many influencers have pulled that one already after very public backlash."
2024-12-06 01:28:36,Logan Paul rug pulled his fans with CryptoZoo and it hasn't really affected him. People think this is going to hurt the reputation of someone whose entire reputation is saying something that refers to a sex act. Not much of a reputation to being with.
2024-12-06 03:49:20,"bro, she knew man, no need to give her the benefit of the doubt, and even if she didn't she certainly does now and is not giving the money back or working to stop the damage to her brand, because she's complicit."
2024-12-06 05:40:19,Hasn't she been talking about crypto for a while now?
2024-12-06 14:17:24,"If she didn't properly research what kind of shit she was walking into with this stuff, she's a fool and just as guilty."
2024-12-06 18:37:04,Yep. I bet she doesn’t see any of that money. She’ll be left to take the blame and not even understand where the money went
2024-12-05 20:30:40,Exactly! I had to scroll FAR to see this.
2024-12-05 19:49:34,That actually an excellent point. I bet you’re right.
2024-12-05 20:05:42,"Aaaaand there it is. She was already in business with those two, it was only a matter of time"
2024-12-05 21:36:20,Tried to copy? Oh no no. They copied exactly 
2024-12-06 14:50:45,"Serious questions...  Are there actual laws around shitcoins? Like what she did was pretty shitty, but what laws did she break? Genuinely asking because I have no idea.  Also, how much did she actually clear here? I read somewhere it was like 50M.  To be honest, she a textbook 15 minutes of fame person. If she managed to clear 50M out of this scheme and not break any actual laws, it's hard to be mad at her lol"
2024-12-05 21:35:42,Devil's advocate: she was speed running fame and had maybe another couple of months of it left. And she used that limited time to make generational money
2024-12-05 19:10:28,Did she make 100 milly though?
2024-12-05 19:26:59,"Yep, like that saying money doesn't change you, it just brings out the real you even more."
2024-12-06 00:55:14,L. Paul.....no no that's too conspicuous.  Let's call him Logan P.
2024-12-05 20:18:54,"We take Visa, Mastercard, Discover and Amex.    That's nice, but I don't have any of those, unfortunately. I can, however, pay you in HAWK.  I'm assuming that should be fine right?"
2024-12-06 04:52:20,Well prior to this tragedy the great engines of the world economy were considering giving up their currencies and going for $HAWK because nothing ensures one that the infinite complications of the global financial system should be reduced to a scam token than a crass blowjob meme.
2024-12-05 20:25:44,Laughing hard 😂🤣😂🤣
2024-12-06 05:01:21,"The scam is that You don't get them, you give them"
2024-12-06 14:09:53,not spit on?
2024-12-06 17:42:15,"yeah, she blew their savings accounts"
2024-12-05 20:25:04,Waiting for... HawkToken
2024-12-06 20:36:19,Baby Hawk Tuah is pretty awful when you start thinking about those words together. 
2024-12-06 03:47:44,Don't *not* be cautious 🚫
2024-12-05 19:08:56,It went over your head didn't it?
2024-12-06 13:17:28,/s
2024-12-06 13:01:56,Totally not another scam shitcoin. Why on earth would you think this is the thread to promote another crypto scam?
2024-12-05 19:39:51,"Ooooo I like that, well done! Here is a fake reward"
2024-12-05 20:33:12,Record attempts recorded @ r/WallStreetBets
2024-12-06 00:30:04,"Uh this is not how it works. If you engaged in illegal activity to rug pull a coin it doesn't matter how stupid the investors are, those in charge of the coin still broke the law."
2024-12-05 21:45:44,"Unless they are were all kids or somehow never heard of crypto scams before, there is no ""taking advantage"" of people who are willing to throw their money at any coin anyone tells them to buy."
2024-12-05 19:09:28,"100%. If they wasted their money on something like this, then maybe being scammed was just meant to be for these people."
2024-12-05 19:26:01,What did she do that is criminal?
2024-12-05 19:16:56,"Don't get me wrong, you're 100% correct, but if years of the same thing happening over and over and over again didn't teach people to not people throw money into random coins shilled by some internet personality, then I don't think they'll ever learn.  At this point, it shouldn't even be seen as a scam; you're just giving money to the influencers/insiders and get a shitcoin as a receipt."
2024-12-06 15:01:27,"lol you’re right,  but I suppose in strange ways it makes sense online."
2024-12-06 16:33:55,"People just need to not fall for this.  Liked yeah it needs to be illegal, but what are we expecting here? It’s not like running a garden variety ponzi/pyramid scheme gets you life in prison, but it still happens.  When crypto was new that was one thing, but now, we know that even the established big coins carry big risk."
2024-12-05 22:38:20,They're st*pid
2024-12-06 00:43:17,"Duh, it’s offensive to s*upid people!"
2024-12-05 19:09:35,"technically she doesn't break any laws that I know of,  she's just a scumbag.  however I wouldn't lose any sleep if the judicial system bends/tweaks the law to put her in jail.  Just like how they did penut the squirrel."

2024-12-05 19:10:28,"Yeah, I highly doubt she’ll go to jail. This will be forgotten about in 2 weeks."
2024-12-05 19:17:05,"'She' didn't.  She is clueless and knows nothing about crypto, smart contracts, token allocations or rugpulls.  She's just the 'brand'.  The devs exploited her naivity and rugged everyone."
2024-12-05 23:51:32,Genuine question. How do you return value to investors on crypto? It's a novelty product with no tangible value.
2024-12-06 08:16:36,How could / would the coins have returned value to investors?
2024-12-06 14:16:01,"Crypto is always a stupid investment. She has no way of making good on her intention to return value to investors, because crypto has no value"
2024-12-06 01:13:10,Slight difference … she’s a multimillionaire
2024-12-05 22:20:40,"Its a Token, Internet Computer Protocol. Blows away every coin in its sector"
2024-12-05 20:00:54,Different scenarios… same result man

2024-12-06 15:13:52,"Because you said so, or what? Lol. Jake Paul's company gave her the podcast, and I'll leave it at that."
2024-12-05 19:51:10,You’re giving him credit of even making it that far
2024-12-05 20:10:20,Did you just assume my gender?!
2024-12-06 00:09:07,Yes and if this is Paul’s second crypto scam they should be punished
2024-12-06 00:55:40,Fame lasted like 6 months too long to begin with
2024-12-06 15:24:47,"A crypto ""train"" on her."
2024-12-06 04:19:19,"It'd be great if it was fading, but doesn't she have one of the biggest podcasts in the world right now? Or is it slowly falling down the charts?"
2024-12-06 06:05:33,Hailey’s fame definitely isn’t fading…
2024-12-06 18:44:59,"It's A Man's World, Vol 13,024, Pt. 12."
2024-12-06 19:00:22,"And then everybody hates them even more and when they go box another 70 year old everybody ofcourse gambled against them cause  they all want to see their asses getting kicked. Nobody would gamble in favor of him winning, people feel to bad about doing something that shitty. And then ofcourse they win again and then people hate them EVEN more, rinse and repeat."
2024-12-06 20:07:08,She went to the school of hard knocks…just not from Baltimore. So she was somewhat intelligent or intelligent enough not to be a dumb ass here. She deserves to do time if she couldn’t be smart enough not to get her rug pulled.
2024-12-08 10:09:43,It’s a lot more likely this was Hailey   Paul’s are worth hundreds of millions now - I don’t see them rugging for $1m
2024-12-10 03:49:56,Just wait until “Hawk Tuan and rug that thang” trends. It will buy her another month or two
2024-12-10 03:50:04,Just wait until “Hawk Tuan and rug that thang” trends. It will buy her another month or two
2024-12-06 03:06:30,I mean I know his it works cause I've seen it happen multiple times.  I've also worked jobs were the guy above me made me at international crimes before at a warehouse and I was only making 11 something
2024-12-06 03:35:40,It’s not that complicated lol
2024-12-06 14:57:04,"Tourist here. I got in the past, got out making a little money and I'm probably never touching crypto again."
2024-12-06 21:08:27,I mean she is still a pretty young white woman who probably has more wealth already than we can ever attain in our lifetime.   If she ever falls on hard times she could do an only fans
2024-12-06 21:09:41,I mean he or his brother is her boss and it's not like it's the first crypto scam they've pulled
2024-12-06 03:55:04,"Dude, listen to the call, it's crazy. You know when you can hear someone speak 10 words consecutively, and from the inflections of their voice alone, your brain just goes ""Oh damn, that's a scumfuck grifter trashlord that's actively lying""?   It's that lol. Clearly some greasy ass crypto grifters like, used car salesman talked Idiocracy Girl into shitcoin grifting her followers."
2024-12-06 04:22:18,"And while all of this is going on, you have the hawk tuah girl sitting in that call just going ""in just here to have a great time and to have fun with everyone""or something like that.  You just attached your name to a multi-million dollar scam, you might wanna take this a little bit more seriously..."

2024-12-05 22:31:17,"If you’re stupid enough to buy anything from the Paul brothers or watch them on any social media, you deserve to get ripped off."
2024-12-05 21:42:07,"With her, he gets double benefit..."
2024-12-05 23:15:13,Given current news headlines they ought to be more careful lol
2024-12-05 23:19:20,"Unfortunately, exploiting dumb people is no crime… for a lot of companies thats their entire business plan"
2024-12-05 23:25:59,They should be on the newly formed CEO hit list
2024-12-05 23:26:50,You'd think people would learn by now wouldn't you?
2024-12-05 23:27:19,At this rate they'll probably be running some portion of the government within the next decade. Perhaps Trump and Musk will put them in charge of the CFPB...if they don't simply abolish it.
2024-12-05 23:28:25,will espousing ‘pump and dump’ concept (spit on that thing) was how she got famous
2024-12-05 23:30:43,Don't worry they are feeding kids with chemical drinks and lunches instead. I'm sure their insatiable lust for money and profit though won't hurt the kids.  .
2024-12-05 23:34:54,Too bad the SEC is about to be run by jokers.
2024-12-05 23:50:07,"Hawk Tuah, pump and dump. Lord, where do it end?"
2024-12-06 00:17:44,"To shreds, you say?"
2024-12-06 00:20:51,For what?
2024-12-06 01:06:27,Crypto is unregulated. You can basically do anything.
2024-12-06 01:44:05,Nah just give them some American Healthcare. Jails too good for them
2024-12-06 01:44:52,How do you tell the difference between legit crypto and a pump and dump Ponzi scheme though?  People are pumping and dumping BTC and others all the time to game others.  BTC partly turned out ok since so many including the founder people paid in and fueled others from misplacing their BTC.  And it’s spread out enough now that it’s hard for any one person to cash out before everybody else.
2024-12-06 02:01:49,What’s the crime?
2024-12-06 02:18:14,What am I missing? Didn’t the coin fulfill its purpose?
2024-12-06 02:21:20,I read that as pimp and dump and it checks out
2024-12-06 03:50:21,"Yup, but just like Martha Stewart everyone would rather a WOMAN take the fall. Always."
2024-12-06 04:19:53,Should have bought webistics.
2024-12-06 05:22:39,Do they work in healthcare insurance?
2024-12-06 05:32:27,They’re silly youtuber celebrities. What more should or would anyone in their right mind expect? I don’t know why they should be jailed for having an equally dumb and naive fan base.
2024-12-06 05:43:17,If you buy Hawk Tuah coin you deserve it lmfao
2024-12-06 06:42:25,And yet....
2024-12-06 09:09:12,Or on Donald Trump’s next list of appointees
2024-12-06 12:30:36,The future president would pardon them. He's doing the same shit.
2024-12-06 16:31:06,I thought that after the suicide forest thing he'd get blackballed.   But I also never thought we'd have to deal with another term of president 'grab them by the pussy'.   Why are people such dumb assholes?
2024-12-07 06:36:54,I hear she's a bit of a pump and dumper herself.
2024-12-05 22:22:32,Haven’t you heard? Reddit supports executing people in the street now. So murder the Paul brothers and you’ll get lots of upvotes.
2024-12-05 22:25:53,its not their fault people make poor choices

2024-12-06 00:22:10,Maybe one of them can box with her on Netflix?
2024-12-06 02:27:31,Yeah. From what little I've seen of her she seems nice and just a random silly chick. I don't think she's sophisticated enough to even understand the pump-and-dump crypto scam.
2024-12-06 06:09:00,"Mastermind, no.  But when Coffeezilla showed up to ask questions she is immediately like ""what the fuck are you doing here?""  Instead of expressing any kind of concern for the reality of the situation.  She knows what's going on.  She doesn't care.  And she deserves to be clumped in with the rest of them."

2024-12-08 07:21:16,She has a lawyer.  No excuse.  She cannot enter into an agreement with ANYONE without her lawyer going over the contract. She knew exactly what was happening.
2024-12-06 04:01:11,"So,,you're giving everyone a pass? Because what's the line then? You're saying she's ignorant, so she gets a pass... so ignorance is exoneration in your eyes? What do you think everyone else is claiming? That they knew they were scamming ???? They all play ignorant. Let me explain to you how this goes  People get together They make a plan They methodically put that plan into action that includes scheming, lying, theft, misinformation, claims of law of understanding, lying, claims of good intentions, they then agree that if it all goes tits up they'll deny it WE JUST DIDNT KNOW, OH YOU WANT YOUR MONEY BACK? SHUCKS, I ALREADY SPENT IT!  They get rich. Zero accountability.   Now take that concept and apply it to literally EVERYTHING that's bad. Education, Healthcare, employment, housing crisis, drug abuse, homelessness, etc etc etc.   But she gets a pass cause you'd like to go balls deep if you could. Jesus fchdjsg christ I wish I was a rock."

2024-12-05 22:26:24,"No, I listened to her on another podcast for a few minutes the other day and she seemed sweet but not very smart or interesting (for a podcast guest/host). I can't imagine she orchestrated a crypto scam"

2024-12-06 00:44:47,"If they do the prequel to her fame, I might be interested"
2024-12-06 05:19:10,It’s currently in production.   Chloe Grace Marantz plays her.  I’d prefer “the peripheral” season 2
2024-12-05 20:59:55,"From some of the comments I've seen on this thread, this is more common than most people know. Sad as fuck as some a guy who considers himself as a classic feminist.  Those lengths of deceit and narcissism are hard to grasp."
2024-12-06 03:53:56,"i mean, scamming idiots is an american pasttime. good for her.  imagine investing in a memecoin and thinking it's a smart move.  Either you are exploiting someone by selling them something of no value, or you are being exploited by buying something with no value. The greater fool ends up holding the bag in the end."
2024-12-05 21:01:03,Well she might get sued now
2024-12-06 03:40:58,"Aside from the typical ""why is she even famous"" stuff she had a decent amount of good-will from the internet at large before this, and her podcast is still pulling 500k-700k views."
2024-12-05 20:50:03,"Because if she didn't blew up all the 'good will' people might have had for her on this one stunt and kept her grift more discreet, she probably could have made more"
2024-12-05 19:55:24,We need another plague
2024-12-05 20:11:45,It has to be a joke
2024-12-05 20:02:20,"It baffles me this person was intelligent enough to make multiple savings accounts, which is more than I can say for much of our population(including myself) but then you gamble it all on a Hawk Tuah meme coin.   It’s one thing to gamble your own money, but to throw your child’s savings into Hawk Tuah is crazy. What did he hear or read that made him think this was a good roll of the dice."
2024-12-05 20:08:29,I had no idea someone could be a “huge Hawk Tuah” fan
2024-12-05 20:03:57,Yeah sure they did
2024-12-05 20:36:26,"That tweet sounds fake but to be perfectly clear if anybody like that existed, I'd be happy if they get scammed every day of their life until they learn  we don't need to build a world with guardrails for this level of stupidity"
2024-12-05 20:08:32,You’re a fan?? Like what has she done that deserves your fandom?! I don’t understand.
2024-12-05 20:24:53,"Kinda hard t feel bad for anyone who puts $35,000 into a shitcoin when its money they dont just have to spend."
2024-12-05 20:27:22,"Anyone putting ALL of their life savings into a single volatile crypto or any type of investment deserves to lose it all. Never invest what you’re not willing to lose, especially ALL IN ONE PLACE.   Regardless, that quote sounds like satire or is fake anyways."
2024-12-05 20:46:23,It was fake.
2024-12-06 21:43:26,100 and 35000 are almost in the same ballpark in terms of life savings.  more like someone who maybe started saving 1-2 years ago.
2024-12-05 20:01:37,🤦🏼‍♀️ there's one born every minute
2024-12-05 20:02:44,My children's education and future ⚖️ $Hawk 🤔  What kind of math was he using?  I'm just trying to see if from his point of view
2024-12-05 20:16:57,"How can someone be smart enough to save up $35,000 but also be stupid enough to do this shit..lol"
2024-12-05 20:26:48,this is the funniest shit ever
2024-12-05 20:33:23,bring her here for an AMA will be more famous than Hawk
2024-12-05 20:33:24,Even worse one guy gave up 1.4 million dollars worth of other coins to buy hers
2024-12-05 20:40:02,"I'd say they were destined to lose their money. A meme coin just happened to be the vehicle.  I'd love to hear about all the other times they almost lost their life savings - now that would be entertaining 🍿🍿🍿  Just like life, stupid finds a way ❤️  ."
2024-12-05 20:50:48,Yea this is a simp piece of shit who hopefully was single and not simping over a 20 year old while having a family and then gambling their families money to support a random chick who doesn’t need it… I genuinely just don’t feel bad for people who fall for this viral coin shit anymore. Its pure stupidity
2024-12-05 20:51:54,I’m sure if they doubled their money they wouldn’t have even thought about her. Just idiots gambling at the casino
2024-12-05 20:53:23,Or it could be a shit post. No one has ever lied on the internet tho.
2024-12-05 20:54:55,"This guy is also yelling at the croupier in the casino after he just went all in on red, and it came up black. Degenerate gambler."
2024-12-05 20:56:32,I have to assume they were lying because that shit scares me
2024-12-05 20:57:41,TBH that moron deserved it...
2024-12-05 20:58:53,"That seems more on the individual, I mean nobody goes into memecoins and doesn’t know in the back of their mind that like:   “this is risky af and took me years to save”.  People have to take responsibility for reckless behavior and gambling."
2024-12-05 21:02:15,That’s Darwinism right there lmao. Well-earned loss.
2024-12-05 21:02:17,"Sorry that's a lie. If they had a kid's college fund they wouldn't have had access to that cash anyhow without penalties and anyone who has a 529 for their kids would never do something that stupid. Clickbait for sure.   Also, anyone with 35k liquid to invest in something as dumb as this is lying about the amount or is literally the fool who's money is soon departed. No one who can't afford to take that loss would have invested that much into it."
2024-12-05 21:06:31,"""But it to be worth just $2000$""  No. Its worth 0. For him it was worth 35.000 ... Nobodys fault."
2024-12-05 21:07:10,And we believe him.
2024-12-05 21:07:43,They wrote it on Twitter so it definitely isn't a parody joke...
2024-12-05 21:11:19,Stocks and crypto are just gambling. Would you feel sorry for someone who put 35k on roulette?
2024-12-05 21:14:07,"There is no way in the world this is her fault.   A ""financial advisor"" or some sort of ""crypto person"" trying to scam people is one thing. Buying thsi coin based on this person saying to is absolutely your fault.  (Nothing against her, she's done great charity things)"
2024-12-05 21:14:24,There's no way that this post is real
2024-12-05 21:18:54,Clearly a joke post. Bloody hilarious too 😂 no one with a net worth of $35k is going with a 100% $hawk allocation hahaha
2024-12-05 21:21:04,Could just be lying.
2024-12-05 21:25:18,"This person unfortunately voided my sympathy when they said ""I am a huge fan of hawk tuah""."
2024-12-05 21:26:12,"lol that's totally on that person, a highly regarded thing to do so"
2024-12-05 21:27:21,people who do this deserve what’s coming to them tbh
2024-12-05 21:27:35,"Dude, you can see on chain there was a guy who turned <$1000 into $1.4M with MOODENG. He put all that into HAWK and came out with nothing."
2024-12-05 21:27:37,guys that twitter post was a joke
2024-12-05 21:28:33,This moron got what he deserves.  His poor family.  I hope they leave him and he is homeless.
2024-12-05 21:29:08,"I saw that too. What kind of idiot whose life savings is only 35k dumps it all on a crypto, especially one that only exists because some college girl made a blowjob joke?  I mean, crypto is an interesting investment but only a fool bets money on it they can’t afford to lose… it’s a risky investment even in the best cases. A fool and his money, as they say"
2024-12-05 21:33:31,Hahahahahahhahha
2024-12-05 21:41:21,>children’s college education fund  I guess they spat on that thang.
2024-12-05 21:48:43,Legit just Lold  This can’t be real
2024-12-05 21:49:27,I mean how stupid are people? Honestly - at this point I think some people just deserve to learn the hard way. Honestly - stupidity at its finest hour.
2024-12-05 21:52:37,"It’s crazy you don’t realize that was satire and not a real, genuine post."
2024-12-05 22:00:47,"Be honest, your kids aren't going to college and you weren't saving for it"
2024-12-05 22:06:00,Average Hawk Tuah podcast enjoyer
2024-12-05 22:09:15,Anyway that describes themselves as “a huge fan of hawk tuah” should be legally denied any ability to make a financial decision.
2024-12-05 22:10:33,I saw that and it was totally fake.  He stated further below on his twitter account (X) he never bought any.  Just a troll.
2024-12-05 22:14:13,What are you a fan of? 😂😂😂 she does nothing
2024-12-05 22:17:13,A fool and their money…
2024-12-05 22:31:00,This is why we can’t have universal basic income - shit like this really makes it hard not to believe that some people absolute deserve to be poor.
2024-12-05 22:34:13,"Also to note, please don't twitter for truth. There are so many trolls and fake outrage stuff on there. "
2024-12-05 22:35:33,"Play stupid games, win stupid prizes."
2024-12-05 22:38:10,Who is a “huge fan” of hawk tuah. What the fuck
2024-12-05 22:41:39,That person shouldn’t be allowed to reproduce. We don’t need the gene pool getting any dumber than it already is.   Spending 35k on a meme coin should land you in an insane asylum 
2024-12-05 22:54:38,for their sake I hope they didn't really put 35k into a celeb meme coin
2024-12-05 22:58:31,"According to another Redditor who looked into the account, it was a troll post."
2024-12-05 23:00:47,"The fact that someone actually typed out ""I am a huge fan of Hawk Tuah"" makes me cringe."
2024-12-05 23:03:30,"If someone was dumb enough to ""put it all on red"" with their entire life saving, they were gonna lose it one dumb way or another. It's not like it could ever be seen as a ""safe investment"" either. They fucked around looking for a get-rich-quick scheme and found out."
2024-12-05 23:08:47,"""You took my life savings"" hahahahahah  Correction--you voluntarily handed over your life savings to a meme coin propped up by a girl who is famous for making a dick joke. And you did that because you thought you would get rich quick while other people get stuck holding the bag. Fuck off, cuz.   Hahahah. I'm sorry. I really don't get off on watching people suffer, but when the fuck are people gonna take accountability for their own actions? Its hard not to laugh out loud at the extreme cognitive dissonance and victim mentality."
2024-12-05 23:09:58,Jesus Christ those poor kids.
2024-12-05 23:10:08,"Buyer’s fault. If he can prove her company somehow created fake numbers or something then yes, her fault. Otherwise it’s nature’s way of thinning the herd."
2024-12-05 23:10:41,"its gotta be bait, no way, I refuse to believe"
2024-12-05 23:12:32,"No fucking way that's real. I refuse to believe, it's just someone being dramatic for the memes. No ones that stupid... Right?   ...right?"
2024-12-05 23:15:17,"I’m sorry but the absolute lack of responsibility for one’s own actions is astounding here. No one ever, for a second thought that hawk was a legitimate or sound investment. They just thought they’d get out first, get rich quick, and leave someone else holding the bags.   I say this as a shitcoin connoisseur myself, I’m heavily invested in some pure hot trash. But if it goes to 0 I recognise it’s entirely on me."
2024-12-05 23:16:16,"If someone is dumb enough to yolo their life savings like that, I really don’t feel bad for them."
2024-12-05 23:18:43,"I, too, am a fan of the Hawk Tuah. "
2024-12-05 23:29:07,Its more likely they are lying and didn't buy any coin at all...people do lie on the internet.
2024-12-05 23:31:48,That comment was taken from someone on a social media platform.... where people never exaggerate or lie
2024-12-05 23:35:13,I mean what did they expect? lol it’s all a gamble lol
2024-12-05 23:38:33,At this point I just assume all of those kind of posts are a lie and just trying to be used in future memes of people sharing their fake misfortune online.
2024-12-05 23:39:53,People can also lie on the Internet for Internet points
2024-12-05 23:40:24,"Interesting, this Article seems to be claiming that's the same person, but another article gave the impression that the $35k->$2k person and the ""life savings"" person were two different commenters.  Happy to be wrong, but I am more likely to believe different people because I would be shocked that someone that would fall for this scam could have managed to save up $35k."
2024-12-05 23:40:24,Financial Darwinism.
2024-12-05 23:48:31,That was a troll post of a common crypto copy/paste
2024-12-05 23:50:59,0 sympathy for these fucking people
2024-12-06 00:01:17,"You win some, you lose some...invest wisely, or lose it all...they clearly weren't wise and lost..."
2024-12-06 00:03:42,"No way this is true though, to make 35k into 2k your asset has to loose 50% of its value 4 times in a row. The coin is currently at -50% in the last week and +300% in the last month"
2024-12-06 00:07:38,It was a satirical post I saw it
2024-12-06 00:08:42,Based on what would you invest that much money and the FUTURE of your CHILD into a crypto currency created by a celebrity? That is just dumb decision making.
2024-12-06 00:16:27,I would be $35000 that post is bullshit
2024-12-06 00:20:03,"I doubt anyone who describes themselves as a big fan of “hawk tuah” has $35,000 to blow"
2024-12-06 00:23:49,That one was definitely a piss take
2024-12-06 00:28:13,Huge fan of Hawk Tuah? A 2 second sound bite? Is this person a huge fan of the cold side of the pillow as well?
2024-12-06 00:43:06,Nah this reads like a meme
2024-12-06 00:45:14,"I'm torn on this, because on the one hand, maybe if you believe in a crypto coin advertised by the Hawk Tuah girl is worth putting your life savings then I can't feel sorry for you... but at the same time, I feel sorry for the kids of those parents. (That being said, they would probably have lost it in some other scheme, so, those kids were never seeing that money)"
2024-12-06 00:50:18,"I mean, if you’re that dumb to buy that much of this coin and not be neutral or accepting of losing it, Iunno what to tell you lol."
2024-12-06 00:50:52,If those people are serious they have no one to blame but themselves. Honestly just darwinism at its finest.
2024-12-06 00:51:38,"I don't want to kick someone when they're down, but if you're stupid enough to drop your nest egg into a memecoin, you kind of brought it on yourself."
2024-12-06 00:53:14,"""Huge fan of hawk tuah""...100% that person consumes massive amounts of red pill content."
2024-12-06 01:00:23,"What are these people even a fan of about her? Genuinely curious, she made a single blow job joke and now people are dumping their life savings on her??? What???"
2024-12-05 20:34:09,No one beats the guy who put in 1.4 million
2024-12-05 21:04:28,Agreed Dumb
2024-12-05 21:28:37,There was someone who bought $1.4M worth.
2024-12-05 19:14:16,If you’re not maxing out your CC during a bull market then what are you doing.
2024-12-05 20:53:42,"$200 usd, and $450,000 in bowlingballtakingashit"
2024-12-05 20:17:49,"I mean, even if they did, it's still not misleading.  Life savings is life savings.  It someone slowly saved from their minimum wage job to have $250 in savings and lost it all on a cryptoscam.  I mean, not the best judgement on their part, but it's not somehow ""less bad"" than someone who had $10,000 and lost it all."
2024-12-05 21:20:12,"Aw, you’re just jealous!"
2024-12-05 21:47:21,Currently @ 41 in savings
2024-12-05 23:19:00,Well....that hurts tbh!!
2024-12-05 20:07:17,If you give your life savings to Hawk Tauh girl I feel like you kind of deserve to lose it
2024-12-05 21:03:43,"Thats a lie, its a damn troll. For the love of fuck,  think critically"
2024-12-06 13:22:34,The article says someone online said they invested their life savings
2024-12-05 20:13:28,That someone doesn't deserve that money. Zero sympathy
2024-12-05 23:53:22,for that kind of money she better be personally hawk tuahing on MY thang
2024-12-06 00:06:19,Do we have proof?
2024-12-07 15:22:35,Literally the amount in my retirement account and I'm in my late 30s.
2024-12-05 20:42:04,That's the real scam
2024-12-05 21:06:36,Anybody with a keyboard and Internet connection can be a journalist.
2024-12-06 00:45:26,"The article cites someone putting $35k in. But it’s easier to be a dickhead than to just fucking read, I guess."
2024-12-06 03:59:15,"Well you wouldn't know, since you didn't read the article"
2024-12-05 19:48:43,Lmao that has to be someone trolling
2024-12-06 04:53:53,Yeah but come on. This lady is an adult. You can't tell me she woke up and didn't realize Hawk Tuah crypto was not a gamble. She decided to roll the dice.  How much money did Hawk pocket from this?
2024-12-05 20:06:23,I'd bet They didn't cry at the casino. I'm sure they've lost more doing other dumb isht
2024-12-05 19:27:33,i.e. STUPID
2024-12-05 20:10:45,"That’s the ironic part about all these shitcoins with no real purpose.  There’s some real Boomer attitudes among the people that make money.   “I made thousands on Hawk Tuah due to a genius financial decision and work ethic. Maybe you should be more careful with your spending, avocado toast…”"
2024-12-05 19:42:15,the name of the game lol
2024-12-05 19:47:10,that part
2024-12-06 01:06:43,"That's just a longer way to say ""they are stupid """
2024-12-06 12:59:32,I don't feel bad for 99% of those rugged here. They were hoping to be on the profitable side of the rug.
2024-12-06 13:16:37,"Are you able to short coins? If we assume most influencer coins are rug pulls, are you able to put a limit sell order and if it gets filled, just wait until the eventual rug pull? The scary thing is that you would need to have enough money on the sideline to withstand a short squeeze but other than that, you should be fine since most of them collapses very quickly"
2024-12-06 03:13:36,"cope the entire dnc lost, not just her."
2024-12-06 01:15:15,Sexism. Two competent women were shot down. The latter was in the face of him being a convicted sex offender and fraud. Even if Clinton and Harris wouldn't have been my first choice they were infinitely more qualified.
2024-12-05 20:01:41,What you're describing is not even remotely unique to America.
2024-12-06 00:47:01,"Yeah, they should spend their free time browsing crypto currency forums to really boost their intellect."
2024-12-05 20:28:38,There's a reason Republicans are against public education!
2024-12-05 22:56:51,I would think in the positive given they work hard and the families really push education. Every first gen immigrant I've ever known was very hard working. MOST second gen are at a minimum being pushed to work hard on education.
2024-12-06 01:13:44,"Well, given nobody fucking stated we're LESS than other countries maybe shove it."
2024-12-05 19:14:16,Yeah it's almost like there is a group out there pushing this kind of shit on people with algorithms designed disrupt our society
2024-12-05 19:10:35,"You make a solid argument. However, if I may offer one counterpoint: hawk tuah"
2024-12-05 19:09:52,Guess you won’t be investing in the new “Grinch” token?
2024-12-05 19:18:33,If she wasn't conventionally attractive then it wouldn't have gained any traction.
2024-12-05 19:13:04,"I believe I read a comment somewhere about a hypothesized cycle in democratic governments, where they start at ochlocracy. That's what it seems like to me: mob mentality. Gorilla see, gorilla do."
2024-12-05 19:13:04,Well said
2024-12-05 19:45:24,Are you suggesting that you prefer blowjobs where she doesn't spit on your Johnson?
2024-12-05 19:12:22,Glorified
2024-12-05 19:34:49,"always has been, not even 'normalized' but actively celebrated and encouraged. people have been trained to distrust schools, reject investigative journalism, actively reject science, and use religion to shape their entire world view."
2024-12-05 19:48:34,"Stupidity and ignorance **are** the normal, and always have been. I and others mention how the average American adult citizen (so the pool of immigrants who may speak ESL is much lower) reads below a 6th grade level, and their maths abilities are lower than that. Europe isn’t much better on average although they don’t publish nearly as much data as firms in the U.S. or even the government does.    Some people are going to say that IQ is intelligence, and therefore most people fall outside of the extremes. Which is true since it is meant to be a normal distribution by nature. But that doesn’t mean those people aren’t woefully dumb. Again, most people are barely literate and can’t solve extremely basic algebra.   Ignorance is a choice people make in the Information Age."
2024-12-05 19:11:34,"Sadly, that is what people like"
2024-12-05 19:18:04,"And we keep getting dumber and voting against our own best interests, thinking billionaires are going to fix the same system that made them billionaires. Hence, their war on public education... the dumber we are, the better we are for them."
2024-12-05 20:02:23,"My thoughts exactly. When anything good happens in the country, they give credit to whichever leader is in charge (as long it's their political party). If something bad happens, though, it can't possibly be the fault of their loyal politician!  Now, flip it around. When a political leader is in charge of the party they don't like, the script gets flipped. Now, suddenly, they blame that political leader for every bad thing that happens. However, any positive changes that occur obviously aren't due to them, though.   It's tribalism and emotional reasoning at its finest"
2024-12-05 20:31:05,"Facts is facts. If you voted for Trump and you're not stupid rich already, you voted to fuck yourself over. I'm just hoping we still have a say in our elections at all after these next four years."
2024-12-05 19:06:50,I think it is pretty reasonable that people who think economic freedom is important would be against that authoritarian asshole.
2024-12-05 19:11:04,I guess stupidity is not simply reserved for the right...
2024-12-06 00:11:52,"Oh no, it’s stupid."

2024-12-05 20:24:05,"🤣 2/3 of Americans voted for Trump? Kind of proving the point that Trump supporters are idiots here.   The popular vote was 77,234,710 vs 74,938,722. That's only a 2.3M difference, and barely over 50% *of voters*. Obviously that says nothing of the rest of Americans who didn't vote.  And Elon? The dude knows he can buy favor with Trump and not with Democrats. No shit he'd support them. What makes him smart in this situation is what makes you stupid."

I just don't have much sympathy for her because I couldn't care less about the money problems of people with fat bank accounts (I'm trying, no luck) but I also don't have any sympathy for anyone who bought any of those coins. This is the dumbest fucking thing. A whole lot of people who have no idea what's going on all thought they were going to get rich quick. Let them burn.

It would takes years to sort this out legally, as in, come up with actual laws about it etc. But I think it should be adressed.   There's nothing that can be done now I assume.  It's just painful to see so many people ignorant about it and still buying into it, literally.    I still think it's not ok to ""laugh"" about the people that were ignorant about it, and say they souldn't be allowed around money etc. It doesn't really help anyone.

2024-12-09 09:47:20,"I think a lot of what they do has really high costs, I bet their margins are really thin. Make £1m but spend £990k in order to make that £1m. It’s probably why we have seen so many failed endeavours by them."

2024-12-06 06:01:28,This. Came here to say exactly this.
2024-12-06 11:03:37,Kinda the same applies if you believe to someone who's only claim to fame is imitating sucking dicks. 
2024-12-05 23:22:16,"> If you’re stupid enough to buy anything from the ~~Paul brothers~~ **Hawk Tuah bimbo** or watch them on any social media, you deserve to get ripped off.       **FTFY**"
2024-12-05 22:58:12,"nope.  there are 10000 new idiots a day figuring out something for the first time.  scammers should be punished.  this ""you deserve to get ripped off"" is just taking their side."
2024-12-05 23:04:23,Hey both statements can be true
2024-12-05 23:46:36,"So, I have children and niblings.  It's a constant struggle to teach children against the flood that is online marketing.  It's not a matter of stupidity. Advertisers are very well educated and they have a lot of resources. Children's parents have to work and we can't explain everything all the time. Children aren't dumb, they're just being mislead.  Mislead children are their target demographic."
2024-12-06 02:07:12,How many people tuned into that Tyson fight tho
2024-12-06 02:21:24,"thats the thing, it's not a ripoff because nobody is stupid enough to believe anything these chuds are shilling have value. It's gambling. Everyone knows that in order to win someone else has to lose. You know hawkcoin is gonna get rugged so you invest hoping to be on the upswing before it does. Anyone complaining about losing their life savings simply called RED when it hit BLACK."
2024-12-06 03:27:40,"Not if you’re 12, though."
2024-12-06 06:29:03,Isn’t it a lot of literal children?

2024-12-07 19:14:22,"Yeah, I feel like it’s fair game. 🤷🏻‍♂️"
2024-12-05 22:49:17,So true. I purposely show my kids videos of people I would never follow / take advice from just to show them who not to follow.
2024-12-05 22:48:09,Goddamn right lol
2024-12-06 01:45:38,It’s sad that you don’t understand why that CEOs murder was justified. Has nothing to do with him being a celebrity or not liking him. His direct decision making has cost an untold amount of people their life.   An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind… but when someone is actively running an organization grinding up eyes; it’s alright to take his.
2024-12-05 20:40:19,He defrauded people with his cryptozoo bullshit. Coffeezilla laid it all out.  Easy to say they have committed no crimes when it comes to something unregulated.
2024-12-05 20:41:23,"Check 'em out. I know as little as I possibly can about them, but they're fucking scumbags who make a majority of their money from selling children shit and scamming others with NFT and crypto schemes, many of whom are children as well."
2024-12-05 20:29:49,I think they were saying that more as a moral statement than a legal one. 
2024-12-05 22:27:44,"Obvious pump-and-dump crypto scams like this should _absolutely_ be illegal and they should absolutely be locked up for it.  You shouldn't get a pass on scamming people just because your fans are bottom-barrel stupid. They only do right now because of these meme coins' unregulated status.  And yes, white collar crimes big enough should absolutely land you in jail. Assaulting someone can ruin one person's life; these dudes have ruined countless people."
2024-12-05 22:25:57,"Coffee already attended the twitter live ""defense"" session she and her team in Bermuda ran.. it's going to be a great video."
2024-12-05 22:16:57,Bought 3 of Coffee's defense fund shirts. He is fantastic. 
2024-12-05 22:19:00,I’m looking forward to it!
2024-12-06 00:16:11,It just dropped 😂😂
2024-12-06 03:28:00,"Is there even going to be enough material for him to make a decent video though? This feels like just a super fast copy paste of the most basic, classic, obvious pump and dump esp if Logan Paul is involved. They just put her name on it and redo what they did last time right?"
2024-12-06 06:09:45,He already dropped it. 
2024-12-06 10:43:08,Do I need another T-Shirt?
2024-12-06 13:44:01,He already did this
2024-12-06 02:40:32,"Yeah except for the part where she doubles down and starts mugging on coffeezilla when he dares to ask questions. She doesn't have the humility to think she could be the one that's wrong and dug her heels in instead. No sympathy from me, I hope she's cooked."
2024-12-06 03:11:52,"She knows what a meme coin is and offered Mark Cuban some ""if she  ever made one"". However, I think that she was probably approached by OverHere or some other conman and they poured sugar in her ear to put her name on it.   I think she is in a cash booth trying to grab everything she can before her relevance burns out. I also don't believe ordinary people invest in these coins anymore. People know these are scams and are trying to 10x before it dies."
2024-12-06 02:35:29,"A literal child recently ran 3 pump and dump crypto scams. It isn't that complex, people are just that stupid enough to fall for it."
2024-12-06 05:36:48,And this is exactly why so many ppl got scammed.
2024-12-07 16:04:26,"In fairness, when she said that Zilla came in hot, attacking the release specifically. She doesn’t know who he is, and has been told this is a standard release by Howie Mandel’s crypto kid. If I just assumed someone was trying to rub salt in the wound when I was hyped about something that failed I’d probably react the same way."
2024-12-06 03:59:42,"lol. hey, not saying she isn't accountable. I just tend to give people the benefit of the doubt as much as I can until they prove otherwise. There are enough consciously bad actors out there, I ain't trying to materialize more if its not needed. If she fucked around, let her find out."
2024-12-06 05:47:58,I’m gonna have to suggest you take a breath
2024-12-06 05:36:04,You’re not a smart person. 
2024-12-06 17:28:04,lol. fuck off clown. I'm just being human. I aint bout to start a go fund me for her. Lock her ass up if she fucked around.
2024-12-06 04:23:51,As if we’re going to have a 2028 election.
2024-12-06 00:27:44,Too young
2024-12-06 03:17:02,She probably won't even be old enough then to run.
2024-12-06 11:53:34,75000 people wrote her name this election   That’s not even a joke 
2024-12-07 01:57:34,"If she ran, there is a very very very very good chance she'd win.  I'm not joking."
2024-12-06 00:28:01,She'll make a great FLOTUS
2024-12-05 21:14:42,"She used the ""attractive woman"" skip."
2024-12-05 23:42:17,Not likely. Our current idolization of wealth pushes aside any empathy a person might have pursing money. I think that’s why empathy lessons are how introduced as lessons in my kids 3rd grade class.
2024-12-06 06:22:31,"trash humans sleep the tightest, unfortunately"
2024-12-05 21:22:05,The only thing real about rain is its wet.
2024-12-05 23:11:34,Her podcast was called “talk tuah” so the article isn’t even clever with it either 
2024-12-06 07:27:17,It's also the name of her podcast so not like it wa as huge leap to make the joke in the first place.
2024-12-06 08:40:48,It's a quote from the Twitter community note on her response.
2024-12-06 00:14:00,Cool story.
2024-12-05 22:20:05,"I think it's worth mentioning because the first guy is getting credit for ""Talk Tuah"" when that joke was already made in the name of her podcast. "
2024-12-06 00:05:30,"Come on, /r/yourjokebutcomparable, at least."
2024-12-05 19:26:21,Also talk tuah is literally the name of her podcast
2024-12-06 14:22:40,Oh give me a break. She is objectively attractive and you’re just mad she is the face of another ridiculous meme coin pump and dump.
2024-12-05 22:25:12,"Dang, I thought one of the main points of crypto was no regulations and government interference...  She's hardly the first rug pull. Nothing will happen. It's why the people (Pauls) who set this up for her (since theres no way she did this all herself or at all herself) knew they could attempt it in the first place."
2024-12-06 00:08:13,"But what she did isn't illegal. Crypto inherently has no value. It is not tied to ownership in anything but itself. It is just Fiat currency essentially printed by an individual or network. It is worth what people are willing to pay for it, and tons of people bandwagoned driving the price up and then causing it to crash when demand eventually evaporated. I don't feel bad for anyone who lost money on this. It didn't go any differently than nearly every other crypto IPO. Maybe the girl sold at the top, maybe she didn't, but I am sure she sold some to secure generations of future wealth for herself along the ride."
2024-12-05 21:05:24,Probably. But she was waning in popularity already. And she had already become a millionaire before this. If she uses this to cash out she could reasonably never have to work again.
2024-12-05 22:26:14,"Her 15 minutes were already up anyways. May as well get one last rug pull in before she leaves. Plus, I doubt she had much to do with this besides licensing her name/likeness."
2024-12-05 20:04:31,"We already have ""influencers"""
2024-12-05 20:21:47,Spit on that thang

2024-12-05 20:28:03,‘Contagion’ style.  A real nasty one.
2024-12-05 20:58:49,"I feel like, and just year me out I love the technology we have, the advancements we have made, love video games. Love the pleasantries of life, but we need a global EMP that wipes out everything, electricity, internet, phones cars, go back to the old days of having to walk or make or grow things yourself"
2024-12-05 21:08:40,Covid failed us.
2024-12-05 21:12:07,We just had one!
2024-12-05 21:35:13,We did but you guys made everyone stay inside.
2024-12-05 21:46:33,H5N1 baby. A few more years of raw milk consumption and the dismantling of the CDC and we'll get our wish
2024-12-05 21:51:49,Congo is working on it. Give it time.
2024-12-05 22:13:20,"Why though? All that will do is kill vulnerable people. It won't change the circumstances which allowed for this to happen in the first place.   We're obsessed with celebrity and social media and consumption and the hoarding of wealth. The people who create and perpetuate these systems aren't going to be affected by anything like that.   Look at the coronavirus pandemic. Nobody with any power or wealth was affected. Yes I understand it was nowhere near something like the Black Plague in medieval Europe. But look at the transfer of wealth from the lower classes to the upper classes that took place.  You're saying you want a more extreme version of that to happen? That would make these problems worse, not better. And besides, it's an example of how medical technology has progressed enough that another plague will never happen.  Like I get that it seems like a good idea to ""reduce the number of people I don't like and things will magically get better"". But take a moment to reflect on the past and look at who will be affected. Only poor and vulnerable people will die. It won't magically target stupid people or evil people. If anything the evil ones are most likely to survive, and they most want to keep stupid people alive so they can keep doing this shit."
2024-12-05 22:18:23,looking like it will be bird flu this time

2024-12-05 22:33:47,"We already had one, it almost worked"
2024-12-05 22:36:32,We just had one 5 years ago. Stupid people died in much higher numbers but there's too many of them.

2024-12-05 23:15:39,Fun fact: crypto is that plague and it only affects dumb people this time! 
2024-12-05 23:47:59,Bird flu on the way
2024-12-05 23:55:21,I thought that was tried. I recall it only made people stupider.
2024-12-06 00:12:38,A real one this time. Quick spread. 80%+ kill rate.
2024-12-06 00:20:04,This time no masks. Go Bubonic Plague and let it really thin the heard.
2024-12-06 00:22:36,I was really rooting for the last one. Then everyone kept talking about “masks and vaccines”. It could’ve gone so much better.
2024-12-06 00:39:48,And we JUST had one.

2024-12-06 00:52:15,Hey bird flu around the corner. Sadly given recent research on how viral infections diminish mental capacity of those who survive strong cases means things will get worse and not better in that scenario.

If someone is smart enough to operate a crypto wallet and also has the foresight to set up a savings account for their kids college, it means they have at least some bare MINIMUM ability to function.  I don’t know how they would have gotten far enough to even have those things if they were the type to do something THAT fucking stupid."
2024-12-06 09:35:25,The post was actually satire so yes
2024-12-06 11:08:31,Does it? There was $500 million dollars in that coin in like 10 minutes. Someone was dropping *money*
2024-12-05 23:40:41,The average IQ is 100 and half the people you see everyday are dumber than that
2024-12-06 01:06:58,dummy that buys Hawk and not bitcoin is the joke.
2024-12-06 04:38:13,Username checks out
2024-12-05 20:15:20,Youre assuming this person is telling the truth and not just joking. I honestly dont think someone who has a savings account for their child would then be dumb enough to put that entire savings account into the hawk tuah girls crypto currency.
2024-12-05 20:16:31,"I believe people lost money here, but I saw that Tweet and I am pretty sure it is satire / fake.  Person basically pretended to lose a ton of money taking a picture after the fact and claiming he put in right at the very very top and then lost it all.  He also threatened her with his crypto lawyer whose Twitter handle he linked to and appeared to be a goofy looking non-lawyer."
2024-12-05 20:33:22,"It used be be folks said “believe none of what you hear and half of what you see.”  These days it’s better to believe everything you see AND hear is either a lie, fake, or secretly cake."

Tesla, GME, Bitcoin, ETH.. everyone wants that slice and they are hoping whatever dumb thing next will be the thing that actually works. Not that this ever made sense mind you. We are going to be seeing the schemes more and more as things get worse IMO."
2024-12-05 20:37:32,I think they were looking at Bitcoin 's explosive growth in value as well as hearing the rumors that Trump is crypto-friendly and they wanted to get on the hype-train. Unfortunately for them thistrain crashed early.
2024-12-05 21:04:08,I tend to notice a lot of people who live comfortably were given their money by whatever means but they did not earn and save via their own intelligence
2024-12-05 21:34:53,I don't want to say he deserved what he got but buying shitcoins is the same as putting it on the roulette table
2024-12-05 21:39:43,"Right, how can you save that much and not know you can lose your ass on Bitcoin"

Spit on that thang, son! Spit on that thang all the way to the ivy league!""  ""You're the best, dad! And also a very smart investor! One of the smartest, everyone says so!"""
2024-12-05 23:21:21,"Totally just speculation, but my suspicion is that most people ""investing"" in these coins know exactly what they're doing - they know the rug is going to be pulled, and they're just gambling on whether they can pull their money out first and leave everyone else holding the bag. I refuse to believe any reasonable person that can accumulate a savings account would actually see a memecoin as a viable investment."
2024-12-05 23:29:41,Its not a true story...people lie on the internet.
2024-12-05 23:48:36,Nailed it. Who in their right mind would do this?
2024-12-05 23:49:07,"Its obviously fake. Most 529 accounts don't let you just buy anything inside of them, only specific funds they get a kickback for."

2024-12-06 01:37:21,"Representations by miss Tuah that the coin was legitimate and certain to make money, probably"
2024-12-06 03:05:35,I mean a thirsty dude spent over 4 million on that one girls OF and didn't even get to fuck her. Never underestimate the power of a thirsty dude. This entire girls fame came from a fellatio reference. Simps are pathetic out here.
2024-12-06 03:09:02,Hawk tuah was all the evidence they needed
2024-12-06 04:38:58,This is why I think it's bullshit.  Why people are believing a random Twitter account is beyond me.
2024-12-06 05:26:20,They   Are  Lying
2024-12-06 06:49:06,They were probably smart enough to know it was an obvious crypto rug pull scam but weren't smart enough to get in an out fast enough and now they're blaming everyone but themselves. 
2024-12-06 08:17:54,To be fair one of the best investments over the last decade or so was DOGEcoin. Using a rational mind for investments these days isn't always your best bet. If you invested in DJT (a company with no way to profit) when it started you'd have ~2.5x your money. May we live in interesting times.
2024-12-06 13:10:25,"I understand your skepticism. It's often difficult to discern whether someone is being truthful or exaggerating for effect, especially when it comes to financial decisions that seem unwise. The world of cryptocurrency is full of high-risk investments, and it can be hard to believe that someone would invest their child's entire savings into it.  People do make surprising financial decisions, though, sometimes driven by a mix of hope, misinformation, or pressure to achieve quick gains. It's always best to approach such stories with a healthy dose of skepticism and prioritize sound financial advice."
2024-12-06 13:55:31,It’s weird your saying the number of savings accounts is related to intelligence.

2024-12-06 23:09:39,I’m a fan of the top of her head.
2024-12-06 03:00:18,All crypto is a scam.
2024-12-06 00:37:23,I would argue that's one of the critical functions of society.
2024-12-06 04:36:00,"The world also doesn’t need scam artists encouraged to keep doing things like this, even if the people they’re hurting are stupid. It’s in all of our best interests to not fill the world with completely broke down dumb people.

2024-12-05 19:07:56,"And yet Trump is the one who's pro crypto, while the other side is Team Elizabeth Warren.  EDIT: LOL at the downvotes. You don't have to like Trump (I certainly don't) to acknowledge that he was clearly the better option for cryptocurrency. The Democrats are quite staunchly anti-crypto, while the Republicans...well, go look at the charts since election night, around the exact time that it became clear that Trump would win. If I have to choose between Elon Musk and JD Vance, or Elizabeth Warren and Sharrod Brown, it's a pretty obvious pick."

But either way after the last 4 year dumpster fire I guess you better learn to get used to Republicans because there won't be a Democrat in the White House four at least 3 elections and probably a lot more now that all three branches are Republican .  Won't be as many roadblocks on getting policies through .  And if the other branches do throw them , the American people are tired enough of the back forth and never curing anything they will give walking papers to whoever needs them.  Liberals constantly say conservatives are stupid and dangerous but yet you idiots are constantly poking that bear lol.  How smart is that"

I admittedly haven't kept up with her so I have no idea if sentiments changed but I thought people had more or less just stopped paying attention her after initially thinking she was a great person for using a lot of her money to help out animal shelters.  Edit: judging by the downvotes, hurt by facts and evidence 😂"
2024-12-05 23:10:03,"I listened to an episode of her podcast, it was literally just stupid jokes and obnoxious laughing. She told her friend that her catch phrase could be “shit on that thing” none of the main crew for that podcast can contribute anything of value to conversation and it’s just them trying to say buzzwords and catch phrases and laughing at immature jokes they make."

Keep in mind, this wasn't her just endorsing some random product. THIS IS HER PRODUCT! under her brand, under her name, under her catchphrase  either way, absolutely not a victim"

So you saw a coin you thought would go up 100x and thought you can wait and dump it on the guy who buys at 100x but then turned out that you are the guy that got rugged and now you are trying to act noble by asking those rug pullers to be prosecuted  It’s like the thief screaming “stop the thief” lol”"
2024-12-05 22:03:18,">Everyone has heard of email scammers but we still describe their activity as taking advantage of people.  The main difference is that email scams at least pretend to be legitimate or the real deal (phishing). The crypto equivalent would be a project that at least pretends to have a purpose (e.g. CryptoZoo), not just some random coin shilled by an influencer.  >Wishing the worst for folks who have already led a life that led them to being financially inept is just fuckin weird.  No ones wishing the worst for anyone. All I'm saying is it is objectively stupid to throw life savings at a random coin that has literally no reason to exist, or that even lied about having a purpose."
2024-12-05 22:10:22,"I know it's not a small number, but that doesn't really matter. I genuinely don't see any reason as to why anyone thought buying this (or any blatant shitcoin) is a good idea. At least coins like Safemoon pretended to be a real project.  This isn't even about competency; its about not putting money into scams that are (or at least should be) obvious scams. The only ""safety net"" there really is for these people is not letting them buy crypto without authorization."

2024-12-06 14:51:59,I agree but people might not have know the crypto zoo scandal or even know Logan Paul was attached to hawk. Also that isn’t a defense for continually exploit people
2024-12-06 14:56:32,But it’s a scam. It’s starting a coin base with no oversight and then selling it to all your viewers who are hoping their lives improve but instead they scam you out of your money and you are stuck with useless coin. I don’t know why it is so radical to not side with the millionaire scammers on this one
2024-12-08 18:40:32,Because the world just needs more cryptocurrency 
2024-12-06 06:42:41,"Yea 100%. I should have been more specific, Coffeezilla is talking to the grifter degenerates that clearly roped her into it, and you can tell after listening for 5 seconds that they're lying grifter trash. And let's be honest here, the spit on a dick meme girl is not a fucking Rhodes scholar, she probably had no idea what was going on."

And which ones are *you* excited about?**  I'm personally really excited about wrecking social security, medicare, medicaid, the VA, Department of Education, FCC, and NIH. Also can't wait for reduced regulation over clean water, air, and oil drilling, especially in federal land like our National Parks. Entirely fuck those!

Perhaps the problem is with the viewers? Similar situation to being frustrated by too many lawyers… the market only supports the demand.

Crypto is exploding, this ultra popular influencer is launching a coin, if you get in on the ground floor you could make serious money. The FOMO takes hold, and you take a gamble.  Don't get me wrong, it is NOT a smart move, but I can see how someone could fall for it."

Just because people were apathetic in 2024 and bloodthirsty in 2004 doesn't mean that this country is more republican.  I agree that civil war is generally a lose-lose. Not sure what the point of that question is, though. The side with more people or firepower or whatever isn't representative of political discourse nor the determining factor on which side would win. Unless you're just trying to scare me into falling in line because you think the right has more people and more guns and therefore must be the best at warring?

2024-12-06 18:41:41,Yes. That’s why crypto is so popular. It’s why everyone in the crypto world is against counting crypto as a securities and regulating them. Being able to scam and have no record of who did the scam is why people want crypto and why they don’t want the government peeking in. Also which government would be the regulator? 
2024-12-06 18:30:04,"You're right that unregulated markets will always be full of scams. It's not a free market if there's no regulations. A major misconception by so many is that a free market doesn't have regulations but capitalism will eat itself - in any market - without regulations. For example, how long until every major corporation price fixes? Or all of them continue to merge into one corporation for everything? This looks like a traditional pump and dump scheme, which of course is regulated for all securities but not crypto. "

2024-12-06 15:53:54,Yup. Its sad. And its hard to really blame people too much for getting scammed. Everyone is desperate to get out of the rat race and are essentially only guilty of well meaning ignorance.  Its unfortunate that there are people out there who try to capitalize on that and take advantage.

2024-12-05 19:36:16,Chokepoint 2.0 what?
2024-12-06 00:48:03,"I'll let you know when they get passed , but I'm most excited that a Democrat isnt in to shovel money to Ukraine or bus illegal aliens in and give them EBT , hotels , etc.  I can garranty we won't be finding anything gender studies in this country or any other, the list could go on for a long book.  With a little cooperation a business man will balance the budget and probably have something left. The country is a corporation , normal businesses can't just print money and keep borrowing that's all Biden did his 4 years. They all have for the last 30 years but him more than any.  Trump has either fear or respect to make the rest of the world fall in line with what he wants to happen because they don't know if he would hit that button or not but they don't want to find out.  As far as the civil war question , it was one that a liberal presented to me and I was kind of impressed with him he openly said the country had more conservatives than liberals and it would be no contest.  Trying to scare a stranger over bs social media where everyone is somewhat anonymous is not something I would wast my time on.  Looking at all social media and random interviews ,polls, etc the liberal part of the country is not nearly as large as you believe it to be .    In reality a civil war would be so quick it couldn't even be called a war.  Liberal Democrats would be extinct within a week probably less and believe it or not you were pretty close to witnessing one.  If there would have been any funny business in this election, even a questionable video it would have happened , no judges deciding no lawyers involved , law enforcement wouldn't have come to the rescue.  I'd say even military and national guard would have sat it out because they hated Biden and definitely didn't like Kamala . Also conservative America does have more weapons than the worlds militaries combined, now I read that in some left leaning media so I'd say it's fairly accurate and considering I know what just the people in my little town have and I've had a buddy in the national guard say he was coming to my place if anything ever broke out that he would have a better chance here because I had cooler toys .    My point in all this and I'm wrapping up what I'm doing so I'm tired of talking to this phone is I would suggest opening that mind up to the possibility that trump does some good , no he's not gonna give another thought to trans rights to compete in women's events or anything resembling mental illness that thinks that's ok. But the meat and potatoes of what is really important to make sure the country continues and isn't third world for future generations he will do good, and also your not gonna get a chance to see a Democrat in the presidency for a very long time , Biden ensured that for y'all. So you can either try to adopt a positive outlook or be miserable for a pretty long time.  Try to look at others points of view without being so full of hate of one man because like it or not he will be your president and calling supporters stupid etc. will probably only provoke the wrong one and bad stuff will happen .  Unless your only outspoken on anonymous social media then your probably safe unless you find someone with more time on there hands and crazy , also has know how and toys that can find you regardless of VPN or anonymous sites.  Most conservatives have much more stuff to accomplish but there are the ones that don't and get pissed over these B's sites.  Either way I leave you with a have a good one and hopefully your new president. Doesn't make you as miserable as you think your gonna be"

2024-12-07 13:25:43,"That site is a state-run educational resource that follows exam board specifications in the UK. All UK textbooks say the same thing. If that doesn't constitute ""reputable"" to you, then your goalposts are too close together. The definition of ""average"" *is* ""a measure of central tendency"". The [UK National Curriculum](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study/national-curriculum-in-england-mathematics-programmes-of-study) emphasises this, too:  > **Statistics** >  > Pupils should be taught to: >  > - calculate and interpret the mean as an average  If you only consider American resources reputable, just google ""AP Statistics average definition"" and you will find plenty of resources saying the same, [such as this one](https://library.fiveable.me/key-terms/ap-stats/average).  Dictionaries agree also:  - [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/average): ""a single value (such as a mean, mode, or median) that summarizes or represents the general significance of a set of unequal values""  - [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/average): ""(statistics) Any measure of central tendency, especially any mean, the median, or the mode.""  Wiktionary elaborates:   > (mathematics, statistics): The term average may refer to the statistical mean, median or mode of a batch, sample, or distribution, or sometimes any other measure of central tendency. Statisticians and responsible news sources are careful to use whichever of these specific terms is appropriate. In common usage, average refers to the arithmetic mean. It is, however, a common rhetorical trick to call the most favorable of mean, median and mode the ""average"" depending on the interpretation of a set of figures that the speaker or writer wants to promote.  I will add that no actual statistician presenting results in academic literature is using the term ""average"" without exactly describing what sense they're using it in. In general, we formulate it as the *expectation* (essentially the arithmetic mean) of some probability distribution / random variable. For example, given a discrete random variable X, the expectation E(X) is what you would conventionally call the (arithmetic) mean, and e^(E[ln{X}]) is the geometric mean."

But then you're negotiating what your gold is worth vs the perceived value of what you want to buy weighed against the perceived value of the gold and goods by the seller.

2024-12-30 06:50:07,7 years and 30 days ago... Thanksgiving 7 years ago?
2024-12-30 06:55:41,Damm
2024-12-30 07:00:49,Lucky you!! Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!!! Lol
2024-12-30 07:01:16,Nice
2024-12-30 07:01:17,"I found $20 in some old pants once, so…"
2024-12-30 07:01:44,Congrats. Happy for you. Nice.
2024-12-30 07:02:37,"Has your friend ever commented on what he gave you, since then?"
2024-12-30 07:05:54,Wow!!! Congratulations 🎉
2024-12-30 07:06:40,"Hey cool man. On a completely unrelated note, can I borrow $50?"
2024-12-30 07:07:16,Woooooow. Awesome.
2024-12-30 07:14:16,Don't reply to any dms
2024-12-30 07:15:30,You have the Trezor as well - right?
2024-12-30 07:17:20,Keep calm and hold bitcoin.
2024-12-30 07:18:13,Please post screen shots of the DMs lol
2024-12-30 07:20:29,Well.  Fuck.
2024-12-30 07:26:24,"Amazing, HODL. Think about what it’ll be worth in another 7 years"
2024-12-30 07:27:10,Now it feels like you have sold a Porsche not an old Audi ^^ .
2024-12-30 07:27:26,"perfect HODL strategy man, this dude actually bitcoins!"
2024-12-30 07:27:41,"Yeah, remove ability for people to dm you I guess."
2024-12-30 07:28:01,Damn some people literally have all the luck. I need someone to get a curse off me.
2024-12-30 07:28:33,"This is me, respecting the nice internet stranger, and not asking for them to help me get my life together....because that would be pretty messed up. Sheesh!  Also, congratulations!"
2024-12-30 07:31:16,"Do you have any relatives in Saudi Arabia, I think I'm your brother🤓"
2024-12-30 07:35:52,Don’t tell anybody! Send it to a new hardware wallet… Since your friends seed-phrase might still be somewhere hidden away.  Sorry to hear about your friend too.
2024-12-30 07:36:04,"Sounds like you deserve it OP.  Don't listen to anyone on here myself included.  If that money will change your life? Sell.  If you want to hold on? Sure that works too.  Do what's best for you and yours and please know anyone reaching out to you in any way trying to get you to do something, invest or get information from you is not your friend.  Edit: after a win like this I like to sit on my hands for a bit and calmly reflect on what might be best. It's easy to get excited. Take 30 minutes and realize there is no wrong answer to how to use this. It's yours now. Just avoid a quick decision is my general advice."
2024-12-30 07:41:00,Congrats!
2024-12-30 07:41:05,"Nice, congratulations !"
2024-12-30 07:42:26,If you sell some keep it at 1 and you’ll be a millionaire in under 10 years
2024-12-30 07:43:26,i would cash that shit tf out baby
2024-12-30 07:48:31,That doesn't look like aTrezor interface. It's connected through another hot wallet?  You've obviously got the login password but have you got the private keys?
2024-12-30 07:48:45,"Thank you for making me jealous, happy now ?"
2024-12-30 07:53:38,"Sold an old Audi, forgot the bitcoin, find it and can afford an Audi R8 now… love this post!"
2024-12-30 07:55:32,November 2017? That was when I started buying crypto too!

2024-12-30 08:02:28,Congrats!!

2024-12-30 08:26:54,did you tell your friend with the Audi? ask him how the Audi is doing
2024-12-30 08:27:43,You're gonna get messaged by scammers. Be careful with it.  Forza.
2024-12-30 08:30:08,Sell! Lol
2024-12-30 08:35:02,Sell it before the end of the year.  Before the IRS reporting
2024-12-30 08:38:21,"Well, that aged well."
2024-12-30 08:39:53,Awesome! What do you plan to do with it?
2024-12-30 08:44:19,Good for you now forget it for another 14 years
2024-12-30 08:44:52,"Oh yes, that wallet fell out of my pocket 7 years ago somewhere around your place. Can you hand it back to me?"
2024-12-30 08:45:21,Please be cautious and quadruple check wallet addresses/shady links whenever you interact with the wallet(heck just even the computer)   Happy for you!❤️
2024-12-30 08:46:59,Story sounds like total bs but good for you
2024-12-30 08:49:19,We love this for you
2024-12-30 08:49:33,OP keep as quiet about this and be as paranoid about this as everyone else here is suggesting! No joke! Don’t even fucking click on links from the same machine you usually plug this into. Scammers are about to try and throw themselves at you.
2024-12-30 08:51:29,lemme get that off you
2024-12-30 08:54:36,Nice one. Happy for you. Cool.

2024-12-30 08:59:28,"Man I get so jealous reading these stories of people just finding a cheeky $200K in BTC…  But congtats, this is absolutely epic. What’s the plan now? Hold or cash out??"
2024-12-30 09:00:31,"Congratulations.   I would suggest you always hold some back, even .25 of a bitcoin will be a significant amount in 10 years."
2024-12-30 09:01:46,"Don't tell this to anyone at all, especially people you know in real life. Read up on advice for people that win the lottery."
2024-12-30 09:05:05,Happy new year!

2024-12-30 09:09:37,"so, now you've seen how much value your old Audi gained over 7 years, place the Trezor back into the drawer and check back again in 16 years.  Then, find the place where you want to retire."
2024-12-30 09:09:46,Sell it and take the profit honestly still made a profit 😊
2024-12-30 09:11:46,Hey I’m a Nigerian princess looking for a prince.. I have 400 trillion billion rupees in my account searching for my prince. If this interest you please send us 100k in bitcoin and we can put your name on a joint account. You will be a prince. And one day king of all Nigeria!
2024-12-30 09:14:10,"Now that's awesome. Happy for you bro. Just don't go happy selling, preferably forget about it for another 5 years and imagine the happiness with an extra digit next to it 😉🤙"

2024-12-30 10:34:53,"Hi friend, can you connect your wallet for verification? 🥸"
2024-12-30 10:36:01,"Who the fuck forgets $14,000 regardless of what currency format it is."
2024-12-30 10:36:29,"After reading your comment, it's just, ""the good you do for someone will be returned back tenfold."" Your friend must be looking out for you from above, literally, so that you find the USB."
2024-12-30 10:39:42,Epic!!!!!
2024-12-30 10:41:36,lol my old Wallet is usually empty
2024-12-30 10:42:43,"I love these stories!!! Waking up to finding $177k!!! I’m so happy for you!!  I have a little bit of BTC on a iPhone 6plus.  No seeds unfortunately.  Blockchain requires iOS 16 and above and the iPhone 6 goes to iOS 15.8.  Are the coins gone forever or is there a way to extract the seed off of the phones memory. Blockchain will not open nor download as it requires iOS 16+  I’ve looked at the avenue of restoring from a previous back up but I couldn’t figure it out and without sounding negative, due to Secuirty, I don’t think blockchain the app even allows restores to older versions.  The amount was around $2k when BTC was worth around $10k per coin.  Bye bye $20k or do any crypto geniuses have any ideas?"
2024-12-30 10:47:20,Seems suspect lol
2024-12-30 10:47:26,"Hey, remember when I broke my cookie in half and shared it with you back in high school?"
2024-12-30 10:50:09,Congrats and fuck you
2024-12-30 10:50:13,Do not tell your friend about this or he will feel entitled to some of it.
2024-12-30 10:52:01,"I am very happy for you but to be honest I do not recommend at all to store your Bitcoin there, that wallet is not open source,And you can lose your funds at any time.I stored my wealth in Exodus for many years without knowing that I was very vulnerable there.I moved everything to a Trezor wallet.I recommend it to 1000%"
2024-12-30 10:52:44,Whats with all of you people and taxes. Just worry about your taxes. Man I am sick and tired of this group of people who always have to reply with taxes.
2024-12-30 10:53:28,✅ Wow congratulations send something 😂😂😂
2024-12-30 10:54:25,"If I were you, I'd withdraw $24,054.61 and keep the rest. ;-)   $24,054.61 = 14K investment into 7% compound annually for 8 years."
2024-12-30 10:55:27,That turned out to be one expensive used car purchase...  Until BTC stabilizes in price - and I do not know when that will be but I imagine it will have *something* to do with the last BTC mined - it does not make sense to me to use it for trading/purchasing anything.
2024-12-30 10:55:59,That's a full house where I'm from
2024-12-30 10:57:51,Congratulations!
2024-12-30 11:03:07,"Sell it and pay off your mortgage. Then You’ll have disposable income for the rest of your life that you can buy back into BTC, it’s an asset that grows the amount you buy per year doesn’t matter.    Either way congrats on your find. Way to be smart about your car sale!"
2024-12-30 11:03:21,"The year ends well,👍"
2024-12-30 11:03:24,Good thing you remembered the pin number
2024-12-30 11:04:28,"Holy crap, you might have one of the highest return margins on a used car sale in history. I’ve only dreamed of this happening to me."
2024-12-30 11:09:30,Hoe about you sell it and then buy the dip again
2024-12-30 11:11:40,I’m your son. Am 7.
2024-12-30 11:13:18,"aged well like wine, enjoy them"
2024-12-30 11:13:57,"I wish i would find mine from 10-11 maybe 12 years old, when bitcoin here in my country cost same as 1$ now. Our professor on high school recommend us to buy 10 each, we did it for school (his) money and then abandoned it... Such a shame now"
2024-12-30 11:16:10,You need to call that friend up and order them a blowjob asap!
2024-12-30 11:16:13,"I’d be so happy!, how are you gonna celebrate this amazing find?"
2024-12-30 11:18:21,"First, congrats man. that's huge and I'm happy for you  Second, don't be afraid to meet a financial advisor, this is life changing money. Not retirement, but enough that if you start moving it around the government might feel greedy. I would sit down with them and see what they recommend, likely a money market account as they are seen as ""safer"" than the volatile markets of crypto.   I wouldn't move all of it personally, maybe just the .85. if you want to keep a coin for emergencies or a big run on bitcoin that's up to you and your advisor"
2024-12-30 11:18:47,I wish I was rich enough to forget I had 14k never mind 14k worth of bitcoin.
2024-12-30 11:22:09,Congratulations wow!
2024-12-30 11:23:12,"Congrats! I recently gained access to an old coinbase account I’d forgot about and it had .038 in it.. about $4000 usd at the time. Not as big a windfall as yours, but still a nice little surprise."
2024-12-30 11:23:14,Fuckin amazing!
2024-12-30 11:25:38,You forgot 14k ?
2024-12-30 11:28:53,OP wanna sling me 1k so I don't get evicted next week lmao  Imagine just finding 171k lol

2024-12-30 11:40:12,"Look at bitcoin each Christmas for the past few years. If you’re in need of it, sell half keep half. If you’re doing okay and can survive without it, forget about it like you did and you’ll have your retirement guaranteed."

2024-12-30 11:42:22,I represent the prince of Nigeria and he has deposited 500 million euros in a special trust account which has been locked up in legal fees.  We can unlock the account with 1.85 btc and the prince has chosen you as his beneficiary based on your superb reddit handle.  Please send btc to the prince's legal team by contacting me back presently.  I must implore you though that time is of the essence because the prince's health is failing and he needs to name his beneficiary before passing on from the world.

2024-12-30 18:44:56,Could you find me one as well?
2024-12-30 18:46:01,Hello. My name is Prince Rizwan of Nigeria.
2024-12-30 18:47:42,Fire!!!!
2024-12-30 18:47:50,So you guys are just randomly forgetting about 14k these days huh? must be nice....
2024-12-30 18:48:00,Hold at least one until you retire. Treat yourself with the rest. Good for you dude!
2024-12-30 18:49:31,Lol this is insane. Congrats.
2024-12-30 18:50:07,This is similar to my fantasy; to just happen upon a discarded harddrive with a wallet.dat file containing a ridiculous amount of Bitcoin from when it was not even worth a dollar.
2024-12-30 18:53:08,What is it with the bitcoin community losing things? I don’t know a single person in my whole life who’s lost a bank account or portfolio.
2024-12-30 18:54:02,"Heck yes!!! What great news, congrats!!!"
2024-12-30 18:55:06,"Such a great story to start the week, congrats Op!"
2024-12-30 18:56:44,Freaking congrats!! That must be an incredible feeling! It’s your retirement plan.
2024-12-30 18:57:09,"I think because bitcoin is so high right now, I’d sell it. I mean, you just won the lottery. In a few months it’ll drop I’m sure and you can probably buy the same amount of bitcoin for way less haha.   But that’s just me"
2024-12-30 19:04:05,Congrats? I hate you.
2024-12-30 19:04:53,"Good stuff, brother!"

2024-12-30 19:19:56,"I stashed some 2016-2017 BTC away from myself on blockchain.info wallets and recently recovered them. (Do not ever use Blockchain.com!) Not as much as your wallet, but .4-.5 BTC is plenty nice to me! 😅 Did you start cussing and laughing when you logged in? I did."
2024-12-30 19:20:01,"Did you text your friend the picture with the caption ""remember that car I sold you?"""

2024-12-30 19:28:00,How many people are running out to buy a hardware wallet to put in an old shoe box at the top of their closet only to be reminded you have it when you move next?
2024-12-30 19:28:35,Don’t lie
2024-12-30 19:28:57,That will buy a couple Audis nice 
2024-12-30 19:31:25,"if i were you, i would forget about that wallet again and check in in about 8 years after we've gone through 2 more halvings"

2024-12-30 19:33:08,How can you forget you had a wallet?
2024-12-30 19:33:39,"I feel good for you! WAGMI yall. We each individually have a choice to cheer, applaud, and believe in fairies"

2024-12-30 19:35:37,Maybe I'm just broke but I got pretty hung up on OP misplacing $14k without a worry. Congrats on the unintentional HODL though
2024-12-30 19:36:13,"Now you have a big dilemma. If you retire the money and BTC grows up much more, you'll regret. If you hold and BTC falls a lot, you'll regret. So, good luck!"
2024-12-30 19:37:46,Nice!
2024-12-30 19:38:07,"Must be nice to find $177,000 and be like “well I guess I’ll hold onto this.”  My ass turning pulling like 75,000 out immediately"

2024-12-30 19:50:46,It’s probably good you forgot about it otherwise you might have been tempted to sell a few years ago.

2024-12-30 20:30:31,"BS.  Nobody just “finds” 177k.  If it was really lost, you don’t deserve to have it."
2024-12-30 20:32:13,"Hey bro. Nice find.  Wanna hook me up with 500$? Would mean the world to me. Currently homeless, living in a halfway house and the money would go to saving up for rent and find a place. I'm saving up the best I can for now.  Regards, R"

2024-12-30 20:40:10,"RIP your inbox  But more importantly RIP your debt  EDIT: after reading your story, transfer those coins to a new wallet ASAP  As someone who does a lot of asset recovery for estates of the deceased I've recovered assets a few times where they were gifted and they kept the keys. One such instance turned into a lengthy legal battle  Transfer into a new wallet before your friends Uncle Bob starts going through his files looking for photos and finds your Bitcoin"

2024-12-30 21:04:03,"I would hold it…hard. I wouldn’t sell some just yet. Hold it for another 10 years. You’ll be well off. And even at that point it’ll be too scarce to sell, I would collateralize it. If you do wanna sell I’d go for it but only 0.35 as I type this it’ll be about $33k. Enjoy."
2024-12-30 21:04:21,Awesome

2024-12-30 21:16:25,I had a pro recover a damaged wallet from 2010. It had fuck all in it. Hurray for me lol. I estimated it had 0.3 - 2 BTC considering I had over 50 around that time but it the wallet broke and I was fairly sure I received a new address payment after it broke but I just recovered from a month old backup wallet. I guess I was wrong or it doesn't work that way.
2024-12-30 21:16:26,Congratulations 🎉

2024-12-30 21:29:41,I'm your long lost relative. Let's talk
2024-12-30 21:33:32,"I recently found that I have at least .5 of the 100 bitcoin I lost during the Mt Gox fiasco over a decade ago that I am able to claim in the settlement, but have no idea how to access it.   I shall look at this in envious hope. Many can imagine how much this would change my life. Congrats OP"

2024-12-30 21:59:24,"If this happened to me RN I honestly don't know what I'd do. With the way Bitcoin and crypto is going I feel part of me would  cash out and pay off all my cars/debts, another part would consider investing it into a Roth IRA, another part would think leave as is. Wow."

2024-12-30 22:09:57,I had a dream the other night where I could travel back and forth in time but only through my conscious so for instance my present self could travel back to my 15 year old self but I would still be my present self mentally.   So long story short I took a wallet that me and my friends used to buy fun party supplies with and loaded that thing up with 1000 btc and I stashed it in my parents closet since they never moved. I had to live as my younger self for 15-26 years until I got back to the point where btc was 100k a coin and I was fucking loaded.   That was a cool dream     When I got back to my future self my

Buuut, I had already cashed out a decade ago when things peaked at about a thousand dollars per BTC. All that was left was $13 worth.

2024-12-30 23:20:14,That’s gotta be one of the best surprises ever
2024-12-30 23:21:08,"By the way, congrats on your find.  I found that I have at least negative hundreds of millions of dollars from old lost bitcoins from way back.  Or rather, I have lost bitcoins that today are worth at least hundreds of millions of dollars. Exciting find, to remember that old traumatic experience.  The wallets and computers they were on were completely destroyed. All gone. Nothing left. Total loss. I have drunken migrant worker neighbors who broke in and entered into my place when I was away, to blame. I won't write their nationality here because I don't want to throw shade on their culture like that. It just is more than a little ironic that some of them have relatives who move a lot of fortune cookies.   At the time, the bitcoins were worth practically nothing. The electricity to mine them cost more than they were worth. So that part was not traumatic. Frankly the lost bitcoins were not even an afterthought given all the other bad things related to that break-in (tons of damaged property, a big mess to clean, time and money to clean, organize, fix and replace stuff, etc).  What was traumatic is that the people who broke in and entered, left my front door open, and let my dog out, and when I returned, at first I could not find him, and given who they were (the evidence made it easy to determine whodunnit), and where we were, I was terribly afraid my dog's days were done. Fortunately I was wrong about that and he was just sleeping in the corner of the yard (or wandering around in it?) which I only went to after running around the whole neighborhood looking for him in a panic.   At least that's what I think happened and where I eventually found him alive and well, if I recall correctly. Memory can suppress trauma in funny ways especially after so many years. Thankfully I still have it all written down somewhere, and I still have not lost that information. I'd have been better off if I'd not lost all those bitcoins, but hey, at least I have a traumatic experience to remember it by.  Other than that, they were mostly harmless neighbors, most of the time, except for all the damage they did to my place. And they were only rude, extremely loud and obnoxious about 33.7% of the time.  And I never even got to send any of my bitcoins to that Nigerian prince for his sister and her girlfriend."
2024-12-30 23:21:54,"I've got an old wallet I can't access, I think it's got half a Bitcoin left. Nice find!"

2024-12-30 23:32:49,sweet shit
2024-12-30 23:35:15,I wish I could find all the coins I let go. I’d have .5 or .3 coins and just say ahhh forget about it. BC was only $8-$9 then. Probably threw away 8-10 coins over a year.
2024-12-30 23:37:03,Yeah so I also got an old one like that. But I forgot what wallet app I used to create the wallet that time. But I do have the wallet file. Is there a limit on trying the password if I ever manage to open it on my iPhone or something? And I saw multiple wallet files. Which one will be the valid one - the most recent/biggest/smallest filesize or something?

2024-12-30 23:50:58,Did you sort of casually forget about a ~$5-8K investment you made in 2017 or was this a “lemme lock this wallet on purpose for 7 years so I can’t withdraw it” kind of situation?  Edit: wow Jan 2017 price was lower than I remember. I guess maybe you’re talking early 2017?
2024-12-30 23:52:50,"That was mine, I lost it… thanks for finding it"

2024-12-31 01:26:58,"Whenever I see posts like this I become sad that I did not listen to a pothead acquaintance in college back in 2010 or so. They were $0.40 then. The fellow used it to buy weed. He kept telling me to buy $10 worth and just leave it alone for 10-15 years.   Good lord, life would have been different.   No idea if the fellow took his own advice. Likely not, but who knows."

2024-12-31 03:15:24,This is what my colleague did.  But he had it in safe box at a bank since 2015.  Didn’t touch it until 2021.  He did a post on Reddit somewhere.   After taxes he had around $120M.    We bought at the same time in 2012 to 2015.  I was much more risk adverse than him so I didn’t end up with “fuck off” money.  😂
2024-12-31 03:17:01,"Congratulations, thousands of us have to consider our lost wallets as donations to the cause so it's awesome to see one guy get lucky."
2024-12-31 03:17:56,damn nice find!   I can only image how that guy who threw his hard disk away and keeps trying to find it in the landfill would feel.

2024-12-31 03:25:13,Congratulations you son of a bitch!
2024-12-31 03:26:09,Reminds me of a study that (vanguard I think did it) said that they tried to figure out what the traits for the best investment people were. Turns out it  was  people who had tried and failed to get their password reset.

2024-12-31 19:44:08,"Congrats! I went through all my old wallets and didn’t have anything. Had to sell a lot over the years. Wish I could’ve kept it all, but that’s how it goes when you are supporting a family! Happy for you OP! That’s a great start to the New Year! You are Blessed!"

2025-01-01 00:06:00,Love it
2025-01-01 00:42:59,"Time to sell soon, don't roundtrip this"
2025-01-01 00:50:27,"Going down the rabbit hole of this thread and I’m wondering, since no one‘s asked yet do you still have the seed phrase to even use it?"
2025-01-01 02:59:31,It’s your day.🤝
2025-01-01 03:35:41,"There is ZERO guarantee that bitcoin will continue to climb higher. These is also no knowing when next crash will happen.   You do however have options. You can hedge your current situation by selling a portion and using that to pay down any debts. If you have cash to do something, then paying off debt is always the paramount decision to make before investing because its a guaranteed move to improve your financial situation now.  Once debts are eliminated (especially higher interest debts), then you are free to “invest” the remaining balance on real estate, stocks, ETFs, bonds, gold, etc.  I read below you say you are more a brick and mortar type person. So that kinda precludes the idea of keeping the bitcoin. Consider risk of losing that wallet, forgetting password, etc. Also the high risk of ongoing volatility of bitcoin. Gold has been around for thousands of years and it’s still volatile. No way to know if bitcoin will ever stabilize."
2025-01-01 04:26:55,Sure you did 777777777777777777
2025-01-01 05:38:33,"Okay but real talk how do you sell someone a car for $14,000 and just forget about the money"
2025-01-01 05:52:59,"You just painted a huge target on yourself. My advice is make sure there is no identifying information about yourself on this account. If there is any, straight up delete the whole account. In any case, ignore any and all DMs. Be safe."

2025-01-01 17:17:37,I’m sure I’m on the wrong thread for this question but how did yall remember and or even find the wallets accounts passcodes etc ?!? I’m sure I made an account way back when Bit was only 8-12$ a piece.. but I don’t even remember what the wallets were called let alone those 12 phrase security codes they use
2025-01-01 17:21:16,Wish I invested in the physical wallets you can transfer into to hold your coin for 100$ I’d know where 90k went 😂

2025-01-02 12:09:18,"Awesome job!  Still kicking myself for backing out of the Bitcoin kickoff. Old days playing WOW, clan was doing a buy in. 100 coins for 50 bucks. Ex wife wouldn’t let me buy. Second worst mistake ever."
2025-01-02 12:11:04,"Now the question, when to sell? Now because next year there will be mondial disruption and consumer IT won't really be a thing anymore so no $BTC virtually? Or in 10 years because it will ×1k so you will get .1B USD?"
2025-01-02 12:40:21,Put it on red
2025-01-02 12:54:58,"Woulda been me too, but coin.mx was a sham exchange. I don’t know any better about exchanges in 2014."

I never told them what I want off it cause I don’t want them to steal it or something but I want those bit coins dammit."

2025-02-15 17:14:56,Niiiice
2025-02-19 12:20:30,lucky you
2025-05-05 14:16:59,If you ever reveal that you own that bitcoin to anyone dont say that you got it from that friend etc. theres a good chance he could feel entitled to some of that money. also the fact that you traded something for a wallet that could be emptied by the old owner is crazy. 
2024-12-30 06:02:43,"So many of these phony stories are popping up, everywhere, as if on cue.  OP traded a car for a Trezor but can't remember which year he did it in, and he forgot about it for years but he remembers the PIN, and he doesn't realize the original owner would still have the seed phrase for the wallet, which means the original owner can still control the wallet...  but let me guess, the original owner of the Trezor died (most of these stories say something like that, because the story doesn't work if there's a connection to the original wallet owner).  Swiss cheese.  Lots of holes in these stories."
2024-12-30 05:24:53,"Yeah, I tend to forget 14k audi trades too. Good for you!"
2024-12-30 05:47:38,"At current Bitcoin prices I would absolutely do some profit taking at this time since BTC is so close to record highs. Don’t need to sell all of it but I would definitely hedge my bets and take advantage of your current good fortune. Definitely sell some of it and do something nice for yourself.   Selling BTC will increase your tax burden, it certainly did mine. I sold $30k of BTC in 2020. It pushed my income over $100k. So not only did I have to pay the taxes on the capital gains, but I had to pay more taxes because I was in a higher tax bracket. It’s double taxation so sell a little more than you need in order to cover the tax burden you’re incurring."
2024-12-30 07:40:11,"Lmao, you just forgot about a wallet that you knew might be valuable someday since you actually traded a car for it. Ok, r/thatHappened"
2024-12-30 05:00:17,Hey that’s mine.
2024-12-30 05:35:19,Can I keep it?

2025-01-03 21:06:16,Imagine what his friend that traded for the car thinks
2024-12-30 04:54:14,I’m in shock man.
2024-12-30 05:13:30,So excited for you and all your wonderful amazing luck…
2024-12-30 05:53:16,Yeah I’m pissed too lol
2024-12-30 07:57:11,he said cercastik
2024-12-30 08:31:47,"I read this in the voice Patrick has when he says, ""So this is the thanks I get for working overtime."""
2024-12-30 09:53:51,Am I reading it wrong or does your comment have a big undertone of saltiness?
2024-12-30 19:38:09,💀🤣
2024-12-30 21:38:44,So amazing
2024-12-31 00:34:55,Dudes got a hammer too.  Give it a look
2024-12-30 09:06:50,What's the content of these DMS?
2024-12-30 23:28:57,I say read all DMs and just laugh at them
2024-12-30 22:04:29,Except for mine. Hi long lost cousin.
2024-12-30 05:01:04,"I’m in used car sales, so yes, one of my cars I suppose 😂  Edit : I sent this in another reply somewhere, but the car was effectively a gift to a friend who was diagnosed with a terminal illness. Didn’t expect/want him to pay it back, as I knew I would get the car back in the next few years (his words, not mine). He gave me this usb, and told me it was worth the value of the car. I accepted it to give him the peace of mind knowing he doesn’t owe me anything. I honestly thought it was pretty much worthless at the time, I didn’t even think any cryptocurrency was really on it. Never checked it. Found the wallet in my box of invoices from the time, called my little brother and he helped me figure it all out. And here we are."
2024-12-30 05:22:24,Right? Sucks when it happens (to others and not me)
2024-12-30 05:08:18,"And happened to find the wallet just now as BTC is within a month of hitting new highs. Not last cycle, not during the bear market, not in late 2017 when BTC was hitting 20k, just now. Remembered the seed and everything, what luck!"
2024-12-30 06:05:00,"Don't forget about me, the hot milf in your area"
2024-12-30 10:38:42,I think this might be a scam
2024-12-30 20:42:59,That man that raised you all your life? Lies.
2024-12-30 10:07:46,Looool yep
2024-12-30 10:05:02,"Yep. That’s very true. Probably next cycle even, so 4ish years"
2024-12-30 09:06:14,Shitt.. Which ones?
2024-12-30 11:07:41,"fuck this guy, I got rare beanie babies"
2024-12-30 11:58:20,Call J.G. Wentworth
2024-12-30 22:15:51,"gotta enjoy your fruits, even if it’s just a little bit.  sell $10-20k and live life a bit w it!"
2024-12-30 22:55:05,"I mean if it’s good enough to post, it’s good enough to sell. I’d keep half in and put half in stocks like vanguard or spy. Having a vanguard account with half that money in it would be enough proof to get a kickass mortgage on nice new home too if he ever wanted. either way I would diversify at least half."
2024-12-30 21:03:37,I tell ya man I would CRY in happiness and relief if this was me. Im so behind financially because of work and layoffs that it’s so hard to even want to live to make it work.
2024-12-30 23:02:22,"Idk, I'd take 100k and let the rest ride. That's 2 hooked, 3 blow, and a 4 PC nugget.... and a boat. And the rest riding. Make your buddy proud"
2025-01-03 12:01:15,It’s just hundreds of thousands of people 🙄
2025-01-01 17:15:09,"Such a dumb take. Either take a guaranteed 100K or have literally nothing, time is not promised. What if he took the 15K back then had an amazing time and then died the next year and never found out about it? Life is short and you need to have fun  you're not promised the next year, next day nothing. Cash 90% out and blow it in a year!!! Fucking LIVE for your friend. It's literally worthless if you don't sell it, just so the people in this sub can keep their shit up, while they probably keep cashing it out as well  😂"
2024-12-30 05:11:08,He passed away 5ish years ago. Leukaemia. He’d be laughing at me if he realized I’m only now looking at that little wallet he gave me.
2024-12-30 04:59:54,"I’m in used car sales, and he was going through pretty hard times. I offered the car for a free rental as long as he returned it within a year, and he eventually offered me the bitcoin which I thought was a scam but took it to give him the easy/noble way out."
2024-12-30 04:59:13,Maybe he rich
2024-12-30 08:50:14,I think most stories of people finding wallets with a significant amount of money are already wealthy people. Middle/poor don't forget about 14k
2025-01-01 21:32:22,I feel like reddit pays people to post cool stories to make threads conversation
2024-12-30 05:00:48,Don’t forget about taxes.
2024-12-30 06:18:59,Thats an insanely poor investment.
2024-12-30 19:09:52,Why buy an Audi when you can buy an M4/M3 competition xdrive lol

2024-12-31 09:41:03,and you remembered the pin??????  that is strange...
2024-12-30 09:09:35,The realest comment.
2024-12-30 09:09:39,Yeah but even still I call bs because he seems to remember the transaction.  Easy to edit number into browser page
2024-12-30 05:43:36,They passed away.
2024-12-30 10:06:40,Lol
2024-12-30 10:06:53,Not if you live in dubai.

2024-12-30 05:28:21,"I forgot to film myself clearing out my boxes of invoices in my office, I’m sorry. Didn’t realize at the time it could get this interesting for you guys.

2024-12-30 11:28:02,The last time I was in Germany they were still using Deutschemark
2024-12-30 11:52:46,The only difference is you not be able to buy 10% with those 500 euro like you could have with 1000DM

2024-12-30 21:33:34,So real question. Just so I can decide how to live my next 30yrs. Have you always been a good person and this is karma coming back to bless you in the most surprising way   Or have you always been kind of a douche and karma doesn't exist.   Cause......I've been trying to be good but waiting  for some good karma be hard work
2024-12-30 21:44:24,"Sir, I'm contacting you about your cars extended warranty."

This account is 3 months old, and this could be a con. D  Oftentimes, there are cons like where the individual will then dm others saying how much the money changed their life and they want to help others, and that turns into them cleaning out your wallet. Just don't interact with dm's   Hopefully, this is a true story, and none of that happens, but if it does, it is a scam."
2024-12-30 05:13:39,Username checks out I guess

2024-12-30 05:50:29,This is one big reason I don’t keep my wallet on a thumb drive. You could have easily lost or tossed it. So many ppl have lost fortunes because they put their money on a thumb drive.
2024-12-30 06:35:26,"There was no seed phrase. Just a ‘trezor’ wallet with a small set of written instructions. Followed the instructions as far as I could, called my little brother and he came over finish it up. I now have a new seed phrase and I’ve been told to keep it secret. Why I’m explaining the intricacies of the story to random people on Reddit I’ll never know lol"

2024-12-31 05:37:12,the good one
2024-12-31 06:02:06,Technically the government doesn’t know he has it until he sells. Hopefully if he holds another 7 years things will be a little different by then when it comes to taxing btc or not haha who knows
2024-12-30 21:34:11,What would the tax obligation be on this you think?
2025-01-01 21:30:50,Unless he loses it in a boat accident

2025-01-01 23:24:36,I’m glad for OP that he has people around him like his brother who knows about crypto because you obviously don’t. Your advice is terrible.
2025-01-02 06:40:45,"The only downside to the '*live fast, die young*' ethos is when you don't actually die young after spending all your money and then need to work through until retirement age."
2024-12-30 05:14:53,Sorry to learn that your friend passed away. Good luck with the Bitcoin
2024-12-30 05:13:11,"Sad to hear he’s passed, I’m sure he’s looking down happy for you. Great story, thanks for sharing."

2025-01-04 01:01:57,"If he was still alive I would assume he might recover it with his passkey during this time and realize you never cashed out.   With that being said, I recommend you transferring this to another wallet you own, with your own passkey.  Any of his family members that might have access to the keys to this old trezor wallet, now or in the future, might have access to this fund."
2024-12-30 05:01:13,"well damn, good friend to offer it for a free year. Karma blessed ya!"
2024-12-30 05:13:13,"You sound like a good mate, well deserved find!"
2024-12-30 05:27:39,That means your friend could still have the keys to the wallet. I'd suggest transferring the funds to a new wallet so that your friend isn't tempted to transfer them to a new wallet before you do.
2024-12-30 05:15:12,Was this his wallet or transferred to yours?
2024-12-30 17:59:51,"I'm sure the last thing you want to worry about is taxes, but note that when he gave you ""custody"" of the bitcoin in trade for the car use, you should exactly note that day and what the bitcoin price was (there's no one true btc/usd price, but just use any reputable index like on Coindesk).  That is now your cost basis and you'll need that when you decide to sell/spend that bitcoin in the future.  When he gave you the bitcoin, he technically should have reported the sale and paid any capital gains, but that's something for his estate to deal with if he didn't."

Technically my business owns this bitcoin which is a little bit strange. I think I might sell 50% of it to clear some of my debt and then hold the rest like a stock. I’m a brick and mortar kinda guy, so the thought of having this much on a computer (the internet?) is a little overwhelming to me. Anyway, I’m a little drunk at this stage and this is all very new.

2024-12-30 22:47:49,Most likely long term capital gains. So 20%. Unless he has a lower income and doesn't sell it all. Then he could unload it over a few years and only pay 15%. If he cashes out now it's looking like a little over 35 grand not accounting for his other income.

I have no doubt that Bitcoin will be priced above 1 million USD in the near future (5 or so years)  Edit: the main point also being that if you hold onto it, you needn't purchase any Bitcoin in the future, and you won't have to pay capital gains taxes. Bitcoin has to be one of the best currencies, if not the best, in the world."

2024-12-30 06:16:36,"As Bitcoin appreciates, you’ve got two options. Let’s break it down:  Say you’ve got $100K in Bitcoin as long-term savings. You borrow $10K in cash against it—this puts you at a 10% loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. Now, you owe $10K plus interest at some point in the future.  Fast forward, and Bitcoin’s supply on exchanges dries up (a supply shock), causing the price to skyrocket as nations and companies buy it up. Let’s say Bitcoin hits $1 million. Your $100K of Bitcoin just 10x’d to $1 million. Now you owe $10K, but your collateral is worth $1 million. Your LTV has dropped from 10% to 1%.  At this point, you’ve got two options:  1. **Take another loan:** Borrow against the new collateral value. Instead of $10K, you take out a $100K loan (bringing you back to a 10% LTV) 2. **Sell a small portion:** Sell 1% of your Bitcoin to pay off the $10K loan, use $10K to pay off the old loan, and pocket $90K to use however you want.  Option 1 is what Michael Saylor talks about in the video—it’s the strategy wealthy people use. You keep your Bitcoin intact, borrow against it again when it appreciates, and repeat the process. Let’s say Bitcoin hits $13 million by 2045 (a common projection). You’d continue borrowing, living off the loans, and never selling your Bitcoin—meaning no capital gains tax. You could pay off the loans if you want, but you don’t have to."

2024-12-30 06:02:47,"I suggested he watch the video because it perfectly explains the strategy used by wealthy families and CEOs to preserve and grow their wealth, and I was driving at the time.  When you sell an asset, you lose its future potential value. Bitcoin is unique because it’s the one asset almost guaranteed to appreciate against the dollar. The dollar’s value is constantly diluted through printing, while Bitcoin's supply is fixed. Borrowing against an appreciating asset like Bitcoin is the ideal scenario. As the asset’s value increases, the loan-to-value ratio naturally decreases, minimizing the impact of the loan over time.  The reality is simple: anyone who has sold Bitcoin in the past wishes they still held it at today’s prices. Soon, it will be the same story, people who sold below $1 million will regret it when we reach that level. Sure, he could sell a portion to play with, but even holding just the 1 Bitcoin out of the total amount, he could've turned that extra $70K that he played with into 10x or more in the future.  This strategy allows you to maintain the full value of your asset indefinitely while borrowing against it to unlock tax-free cash when you need it, as Bitcoin continues to rise. Those who fail to understand this will miss out on the generational wealth they could have preserved."
2024-12-30 10:43:54,"There are two real options here. The first is to continue to invest. Adding to an already existing asset. The other is to treat it like a reverse mortgage take out say 5% of its value and reinvest that into other assets. Those assets could be property (ie an existing mortgage), ETF’s or some sort of collectable. Then 2 years later, do the same again."

2024-12-30 08:17:32,This. Same with any windfall. Decisions need to be made based on what you have now without regard to how you got there.
2024-12-30 05:10:36,"I think it all depends on where OP is in life. If older or struggling, sell enough to keep you above water. If younger and not struggling, hold."
2024-12-30 08:54:30,Then all you would have to do is simply hold the BTC… how do you think it got to $170k in the first place?
2024-12-30 06:43:01,How do you pay for the 100k loan in option 1
2024-12-30 07:17:05,"The point is, i can't borrow $10K in cash against it. If you disagree, show me were it can be done, but this is NEVER answered in any thread."
2024-12-30 07:16:44,I guess just the actual practice of borrowing against shares/stocks/cryptos. Do you literally tell your broker you want to refinance your asset like you would a property?
2024-12-31 02:01:15,How how do you get around having to pay taxes on it? Just never convert to USD?

2024-12-30 06:16:43,"Well wealthy families and CEOs have a lot more than $180,000 to invest and a lot more liquid cash for their own use than the average person.   They can also afford to be much less risk averse with highly unpredictable assets like Bitcoin.  Your strategy outright refuses to even entertain the possibility that Bitcoin's price may drop."
2024-12-30 07:02:34,"What if you borrow against BTC and then we enter a bear cycle and OP is forced to sell at a much lower price to pay off cash loan? You’re suggesting a strategy for wealthy individuals that have enough cash on hand to hold through a bear market, it might not be suitable for OP."
2024-12-30 06:35:38,I have one question- if you borrow against Bitcoin then how do you repay the loan?
2024-12-30 07:42:56,"I don't understand the term ""borrowing against it"". What does it mean?"

2024-12-30 11:53:48,This is all considering bitcoin will keep rising.
2024-12-30 12:00:28,How does one even use the money from this? How easy is it to borrow against BTC? The issue I have with holding is that you don't get to cash in some of the value
2024-12-30 13:28:14,i sold bitcoin in the past and i am not wishing i would still hold at today’s prices :)
2024-12-30 19:18:22,"Agree with your synopsis and have been doing it to an extent on a loan I have at 5%. That has been working out fine. I'm contemplating doing so with a portion of a loan at 12%, I'm just uncertain that that will work out during my short time horizon (due to age and medical issues). What are your thoughts there?

2024-12-30 07:13:54,"""almost guaranteed""  Source: I made it up"
2024-12-30 11:32:50,"In theory it is viable, in reality it is not currently remotely viable.   Celsius worked out well...  Nexo no longer do attestation of AUM...  Does anywhere currently offer a safe, attested, way to loan against BTC, without giving up custody?"
2024-12-30 08:00:42,What happens when you're the last one owning Bitcoin tho?
2024-12-31 16:00:39,I know but bitcoin is not going to keep going up at the rate is has. Sooner or later your returns will diminish.
2024-12-30 06:47:20,"These are collateralized loans, so your original bitcoin collateral which at the beginning was 100k in total value, after a 10x price increase over a number of months & years, is now worth $1 million dollars.  So in other words, the 1 bitcoin you held as collateral started at $100k value, and now the 1 Bitcoin is worth $1m per coin, make sense?  So because your collateral is now worth $1 million, and your current loan is only 1% of the total value of your collateral, you will be eligible to increase your loan to value. If you increase your loan to value up to 10% (where it started at the beginning), you will be at a $100K loan. It may take a few laps in your head to wrap your mind around the concept, read it a few times."

2024-12-30 07:30:47,Zero interest credit cards. Spend on credit and use money to buy bitcoin. By the time I have to pay off the credit I have basically got a 50%-100% discount. It’s a short position against the dollar because it’s guaranteed to keep going down in value
2024-12-30 11:27:17,"Nexo, I believe."
2024-12-30 12:23:17,https://firefish.io/
2024-12-30 06:23:10,"It's only unpredictable if you don't understand it. It's extremely predictable for the people who know why it's basically only gone up since its creation and will almost undoubtedly continue to. It's the closest thing to perfect money that's ever been devised and likely ever will be. In my humble, non-advisory opinion, it's far more risky to have anything but Bitcoin instead of Bitcoin."
2024-12-30 06:29:01,">Well wealthy families and CEOs have a lot more than $180,000 to invest and a lot more liquid cash for their own use than the average person.  This is true, the more money you have, the better this strategy will work, because it allows you to keep your loan to value low to get decent cash allotments. Don't lose sight however of how much btc is expected to appreciate against the dollar. We could be looking at a 1 million per btc in 2025/2026 time frame based on supply demand dynamics, not to mention adoption levels. So the average person for the first time has more access to such a strategy that we ever have before, as our modest btc savings are expected to 10x and more in a short amount of time, making this strategy ideal.  >Your strategy outright refuses to even entertain the possibility that Bitcoin's price may drop.  Not true, this is why I talked about small amounts of collateral loans at 10% or less. BTC would have to do a 80% to 90% drop to pose a threat of liquidation. There is too much adoption to see drops that deep anymore, but even if we did see it, it would be bought up incredibly fast by all the nation-state, and corporate players now in the bitcoin game. Keeping the loan at 10% LTV ensures a healthy buffer against drops."
2024-12-30 07:10:01,"You are only forced to sell when your Loan to value (LTV) reaches the upper limit set by the terms of the loan. This is usually between 70% and 90% depending on the lender. This means your 10% ltv in the example would have to see bitcoins value drop until it reached those levels, which is about an 80% drop in btcs value. The lower you keep your LTV, the less risk of liquidation. Conventional wisdom tells us that based on the current state of world adoption (countries and companies building bitcoin reserves, including the US building a reserve), AND the fact that bitcoin is running out on exchanges, that an 80% drop in value is highly unlikely.   In the event of btc dropping heavily, you can add more collateral at any time."
2024-12-30 10:14:14,you borrow at the 200week ma..
2024-12-30 12:27:35,It's all about how much available cash you for how long
2024-12-30 06:53:24,"he can still enjoy the value today by taking a loan with the btc as collateral. With a 170K collateral, he could do a 10% loan and have 17K to play with, and when btc is worth 1m per coin in a few years, his 170K value btc will be worth 1.7 million, and that tiny little 17k loan can be either paid directly by selling a small amount of btc, or he can renew his loan to 10% ltv again and pocket another 150K to play with at that time.  The important concept of this strategy is, you NEVER lose any of your btc holdings, and its appreciative value forever benefits you.  If he sold his 70K worth today, thats like losing 700K when bitcoin is worth 1 million per coin."
2024-12-30 06:43:33,"Do a youtube search on this strategy, its called ""Buy, borrow, die"". This is what ceo's like elon for example use to live on with their stock. They borrow against the value, and live on the proceeds tax free."
2024-12-30 06:42:36,I just wrote about that in this post a few minutes ago. I'll link you to it rather than rewrite everything =)  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1hpfduu/comment/m4hhbp3/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1hpfduu/comment/m4hhbp3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)
2024-12-30 07:52:03,"I'll give you an example using real estate.  You buy a house for 200K in 2010. In 2024, the value of your house is now 300K.   You finished paying your mortgage and now completely own the house valued at 300k. You can now ""Borrow against"" your houses' 300k value by taking out a loan and using your house as collateral.  a 50% loan for example would give you 150K loan (50% of 300k).  So with bitcoin its the same concept.  If you own 1 bitcoin and it is worth 100K today, and in a few years 1 bitcoin is worth 1 million. If you borrowed 10K against your bitcoins 100K value in 2024, and in 2026 your bitcoin is worth 1 million, that 10K that you owe is very small compared to your total 1m value of the bitcoin collateral. Easy to pay off.  Hope that helps."

2024-12-30 19:54:59,"Here is what I see. The 4 year cycle has been a safe bet for bitcoin returns. No one has lost any money in bitcoin holding for any 4 year period since it was created.   That said, the 4 year cycle may be changing due to adoption increasing, and the fact that bitcoin has a finite supply.   Bitcoin on exchanges is in the neighborhood of 2 million btc. Once that has depleted, the market price of bitcoin will be forced upward as demand continues to increase.  The company MicroStrategy has been averaging just over 10,000 bitcoin purchased per week. So that means that by themselves micro strategy will deplete the bitcoin supply and roughly 200 weeks. That’s 3.8 years for just one company to buy up the entire supply if they keep it up at the same rate. This of course doesn’t take into account of other companies, and countries who are now building national bitcoin reserves. We are very much looking at an acceleration and purchases around the world that could deplete the bitcoin supply within one year even. What is certain is bitcoin supplies will run out, what is uncertain, is the timeframe."
2024-12-30 23:13:39,"Well, let’s have a constructive conversation about it. Please tell me how that statement is false and we can hash it out from there."
2024-12-30 07:47:10,"Which part of my argument do you believe doesn't hold up, where's the hopium? Do you not think The US plans to implement a national bitcoin reserve? Do you not believe that the ""Hard"" monetary properties of Bitcoin makes it a sought after asset for storing long term value better than other financial instruments? Or do you think the demand won't continue to rise though we are at around than 400M users world wide out of billions of possible people? Which part doesn't check out?  Please, you tell me what you think will happen to the price when the available bitcoin on exchanges reaches near zero. Microstrategy by themselves are buying up bitcoin at a rate of 10K bitcoins per week, and with 2m on exchanges, how many days do you think it will take for just the 1 company microstrategy to buy up the available btc on exchanges. Thats 200 days at the current rate, its an eye-opening revelation. When you start factoring in the US strategic bitcoin reserve which is coming, and other nations, and other companies getting btc for their own reserves, the time frame will be dramatically lessened.  I'm doing nothing more than pointing out current facts, and extrapolating where the current situation will take us if it keeps this rate of adoption."
2024-12-30 07:17:10,"If you aren’t able to connect the dots of supply and demand dynamics, against the dollar which is infinitely printed and debased, and not understanding how that makes the price go up indefinitely, the that is certainly a you problem.

2024-12-30 08:05:48,"No disrespect meant, but if you ask this question, you don't understand what makes bitcoin valuable. Once you understand that bitcoin holds value long term, protects from inflation, has all the properties of sound money - doing it better than gold, is the most secure monetary network on earth, and is a harder asset than every other asset out there. Then you start to realize that no single person will be the last person to own bitcoin, it will be the opposite, you might be the last person not to own it from not understanding why its valuable."
2024-12-30 07:59:27,"Yes but you still need to pay off the loan at some stage with some form of income. IMO, there is value in not having the stress of having a debt. If you have other income-generating assets that can pay it off then great but if you're relying on your own work to generate income then you're still on the treadmill of life. Of course, if you are earning anyway then this is certainly better than paying tax on your BTC sale."

The only requirement is the loans have to be kept healthy by keeping them within the allowed Loan to value limits.

2024-12-30 23:40:07,"Well lets break that down my friend.  The dollar doesn't appreciate at all. The reason it doesn't appreciate, and in fact depreciates in value, is due to it being printed constantly, diluting its value. The monetary printing that occurs at the federal reserve is massive and unrelenting. Each time you print more, it devalues the dollars in circulation. This is the source of our inflation.  After covid occurred, we had a sharp increase in our total cash supply, of up to 42%, causing massive inflation. The money printers haven't stopped printing either.   Bitcoin on the other hand has a fixed supply of 21 million coins. It cannot be inflated like the dollar can be. This is why the statement ""Almost guaranteed"" to go up against the dollar is agreed upon by many. The only thing that would make this not true is some sort of catastrophic failure of bitcoin where it completely failed and went to 0 value. Outside of that doomsday scenario, bitcoin will always go up against the dollar."

Even though this guy has an AMAZING windfall of 1.85 BTC, if he chooses to sell for fiat and have fun blowing through it really fast, then he will regret it. Hopefully, he’ll take this opportunity to try and learn why BTC is the hardest money and once in a lifetime paradigm shift in what money is and will be in the future.  It’s hard to argue with people that are downvoting your advice because they’ve been so trained on the fiat system (as we ALL were) that it’s really tough to break out of that mindset. Once the truth of what Bitcoin is “clicks” they will understand and regret selling, or not buying enough when it was this cheap.  I’m with you 100%, and it’s just frustrating that not everyone wakes up to the reality of how terrible the fiat system really is. The outright theft that is taking place right under our noses every time we get a paycheck. I’m stacking as aggressively as I can now, but I had to learn the hard way too until I finally woke up and it “clicked”.  Stay humble and stack sats, my friend.

2024-12-30 07:50:49,"More people add bitcoin to their exchange wallets to sell as the price goes up, it’s not hard. There isn’t a fixed amount of btc available, it can change in minutes.  The strategic reserve will be a nothing burger, just like other things Trump promised. How’s “build the wall” working out?"
2024-12-30 20:23:04,Binance does that you mofo...  Source: I have a loan running exactly that way at the moment!
2024-12-30 07:50:39,"How would a defi loan work in this context? If he borrows 10% against his $170k, does $17k extra show up in his….wallet I guess, in the form of some kind of crypto like usdt or even btc, and he would convert it into fiat and cash out through annexchange like coinbase?"
2024-12-30 09:57:56,What a dipshit.
2024-12-30 23:44:28,A fixed supply does not guarantee appreciation
2024-12-30 08:49:24,"Sounds like we have some Buttcoiners in here today, lol. Just know that you make perfect sense, and it’s quite obvious you’ve done your homework, my friend… Their loss if they simply want to be contrarians and equate BTC to “every other money” out there…"
2024-12-30 07:24:22,Sick rebuttal. Your parent comment is still retarded.
2025-01-30 06:43:19,"Maybe, but after going back and forth with 20 other people that tried to help guide him, he’s just being obtuse and I’m not gonna hold his hand while kicks and screams against trying to learn something 🤷🏾‍♂️"
2024-12-30 19:34:44,"It will continue to go up in value because dollar will keep getting devalued. This is why I said do it in bear market or going into halving year. You don’t want to do that at peak cycle or yes, you will be screwed unless you have money to cover costs but it basically makes your cost of living for that 12-18 months 50% discount - free, depending when you time it"
2024-12-30 19:40:36,"Assuming a US citizen gets scammed by another US citizen it's relatively straightforward, In my drug days I knew a girl who reported her heroin stolen and the resulting criminal case paid her restitution in the amount of 8 thousand dollars USD (they obviously didn't pay her in heroin).   In that scenario the perp is guilty of numerous state and federal laws and as long as you're willing to testify and give up access to wallets/data you'll get restitution, though if they already liquidated the Bitcoin there's a strong chance you'll get paid in USD and have to reconvert, though you could probably claim your original cost basis on taxes if you wanted later on.   Internationally you'd have to go the cyber-PI route or you'd need it to be an amount that warrants FBI/international investigation so you might be more screwed but no more screwed than you are in the case of sending dollars or steam cards to a Nigerian prince. Less screwed because there's a very straightforward transaction tracking system when it comes to Bitcoin. Hell, depending on the wallet it doesn't even send your signatures through the Tor network anymore."
2024-12-30 12:28:40,Yep I’m pretty much doing similar strategy and same opinion. Glad to see I’m thinking along the same lines as a real bitcoin OG. $10 that’s crazy man :)
2024-12-30 13:01:51,"Im talking about YTD, 40k wasn’t even the low these last few years. If we’re actually talking about the low, it’s a 3 or 4x no?"
2024-12-30 09:13:08,"Couldn't have said it better, glad to meet the enlightened few people that are out there these days. Cheers"
2024-12-30 21:34:15,"Ah thanks, wasn't aware. But apparently not in US and not your keys.  ""When using Binance's centralized platform, you do not retain control over your private keys.

2024-12-30 07:55:57,"Typically, you receive a stablecoin, so if he borrowed that 17k, he'd receive like 17k usdt.  In the future, he can repay that 17K usdt (plus interest), but if his btc collateral went up in value a lot (to 1M per btc lets say), he has the option of doing the loan process (again at 10% if he likes), but the new loan at 10% allows him to borrow 170k and maintain the 10% ltv. He can either perpetuate this as bitcoin rises as expected forever against a dollar thats being debased. Or he can at any time sell a bit of collateral off to satisfy the loan (best to sell collateral after its gone up by 10x right?)"
2024-12-31 00:27:55,"That is true. Fixed supply alone doesn't dictate its value. It is however one of the most important aspects, because we are in a monetary war where politicians manipulate the supply of the currency to their benefit.   There's a fixed supply of my sweaty socks, but those aren't valuable right? So what more than fixed supply makes bitcoin valuable is the question.   There's a huge list, but lets focus on the big ones.  * **Bitcoin has all the properties of Sound Money (also known as Hard money):** [https://www.cryptodispensers.com/blog/understanding-bitcoin-as-sound-money]() * **The world has used Gold as its hard money for thousands of years, but bitcoin is a harder money than gold:** [https://www.hardmoneyhistory.com/bitcoin-sound-money]() * **Bitcoin's network is the most secure in the world:** [https://woolypooly.com/en/blog/is-bitcoin-safe]()  The dollar on the other hand is a currency, not a money. Gold & Bitcoin are money. The difference between currency & money is currencies don't store value over the long term. In this case, the dollar's inflationary property due to printing makes it not store value over the long term. It devalues while bitcoin's value increases with both adoption and scarcity."
2024-12-30 08:56:48,"Yeah, i stopped caring about the nay sayers long ago. Their losses don't effect me."
2024-12-30 07:35:16,"The moment you said crypto, and i assume you include bitcoin in that description, has no utility or use outside of crime, it no longer is worth it to discuss it with you."
2024-12-30 22:08:16,Sorry if these questions seem redundant but what is a halving year? What do you mean 12-18 months of 50% percent discount for free?
2024-12-31 01:31:56,"I’m kind of a dumb dumb with this stuff, but say energy consumption continues to skyrocket, and bitcoin mining starts competing with energy consumption of super computers and quantum computing-could that affect the price? Like a global energy shortage for example."
2024-12-30 19:54:40,A lot of assumptions. Also comparing bitcoin theft to heroin theft is funny.
2024-12-30 19:39:14,That's a really really big if.
2024-12-30 12:30:22,"Haha I’m not really a bitcoin OG, I fucked up a lot of times, made mistakes and don’t have any of the coins left now that I originally bought at that price.   Things were very different back then and I was a lot younger and dumber!"
2024-12-30 13:04:26,It’s meaningless. We’re talking about 10x the current ath.   There’s no point saying you’re up YTD unless you bought Jan 1st. Your btc was still down on its ath until we broke 70k. Progress has been sluggish I doubt Btc has even outperformed the S&P500 if you measure from the 69k high. People thinking we are gonna magic up a 10x from here is truly laughable.
2024-12-30 22:17:37,"The bitcoin halving years where the supply that the miners can get as a reward are cut in half. This means that even if demand remains the same, it causes a supply squeeze and the price goes up. If you get a zero interest credit card and use it for living expenses, then use the money you would have spent on bills and cost of living to buy bitcoin and only make the minimum payments on the credit card. By the time you would have to start paying interest on a zero interest credit card (usually 12-18 months depending on who issues you the credit line). Your bitcoin will be worth much more than you would have spent on bills and living. Then if you need to use some of the bitcoin to pay off the credit line before you have to start paying interest, you will usually end up with 50% - 100% of what you would have just spent on bills and living"
2024-12-30 22:29:46,"Basically using debt as a financial tool to live your life at a discount or potentially free, like you never had to spend any money to survive"
2024-12-30 19:59:53,"Just proving a point from the extreme. Theft is illegal it doesn't matter if the item stolen itself is a registered security, commodity or illegal drug."
2024-12-30 20:01:21,"Also yeah there are assumptions my statement was you have a better chance of getting the Bitcoin back than the dollars or steam cards, the Bitcoin is at least fully traceable, right down to the coins not being fungible."
2024-12-30 13:41:24,"Then what’s the point of talking about talking about a 2x from the top if you didn’t buy the top? 🤷‍♂️  I mean, you’re saying my measurements are arbitrary but you’re throwing out arbitrary measurements too.  I agree tho, I don’t really see a 10x from here. Even a 2x seems very unlikely in the next year, maybe even in the next couple years. Who knows tho, I’ve thought before that we hit the ceiling and it keeps going hope.  $1M BTC seems like straight hopium"
2024-12-30 23:09:11,"Ah I see thanks for the in-depth explanation, would this affect your credit score paying only the minimum for a year or so? Is there anyway to predict a halving year or to know where we are in the cycle to know when to take advantage?"
2024-12-30 20:11:50,"Just searched twitter for the phrase ""btc wallet drained"", found 50+ posts, people got their wallets drained either through hacks, malware, social engineering or some other way. None of them will get their crypto back.  Also, nigerian prices and steam cards are irrelevant here. Those are cases of people willingly giving money to others."
2024-12-30 13:43:23,I am talking about ATHs because the comment I was replying to ($1m/coin) would be a new ATH. It seemed to me to be a reasonable reference point.  If btc drops to 10k suddenly tomorrow and creeps back to 100k eventually that is indeed a 10x but I don’t think it’s really relevant or impressive to the overall performance of the investment long term.
2024-12-30 23:21:28,"No it will not hurt credit at all as long as you are making minimum payments on time ,and if you have other credit lines have them clear to minimum debt on them and whatever you spend try to keep below 30% of total credit utilization. If you go over probly won’t matter much as it will be paid off in full in a small window. The last one was april 17 2024. It happens every 4 years and causes a supply squeeze. The next bitcoin halving date is March 26th 2028. Look up past bitcoin halving dates and compare on charts you will see the supply squeeze I am talking about"
2024-12-30 20:16:11,Yeah most of those people are probably themselves scammers trying to get donated BTC.
2024-12-30 20:27:10,"Yup, blame the victim.  Edit: can you point me to the source of your claim about restitution for stolen btc?"
2024-12-05 14:32:35,Looks better after decade 😅

2024-12-05 15:29:45,Either this guy has millions in a wallet or zero 😂 but him being that excited for bitcoin in 2013 makes me believe he’s doing fine lol
2024-12-05 15:09:22,He had to repurchase his old apartment building he lived in at the time to create this video
2024-12-05 14:32:00,Screenname  \[  \] does  \[x\] does not  check out.

2024-12-05 21:38:13,It wasn't easy to get a replica video this exact. Even more wild that Coinbase built a set that's almost an exact recreation of my apartment from 2013. So honored to have been a part of the Bitcoin story.
2024-12-05 15:19:26,I wish I was there in 2013 and not just a 22 year old doing stupid stuff

2024-12-05 16:32:21,Which means it will come down again for an opportunity to load up again!  The Silent Generation had gold. Boomers had real estate. We have CRYPTO.  It hasn't even really started yet. You're not too late.  Be ready in the next few years for the next opportunity to load the boat again.
2024-12-05 16:32:24,Remind me in 5 years when it hits $1 million

2024-12-05 16:46:51,Someone link his skincare routine because this man had a glow up for real
2024-12-05 16:50:39,bros skin improved so much!
2024-12-05 16:51:34,Why does he look almost exactly the same after 10 years? I guess money keeps you young!
2024-12-05 16:51:51,"10 years apart, he still in the same house."
2024-12-05 16:52:50,Hero! He F’ing nailed it perfectly! Amazing.
2024-12-05 16:53:10,"The same apartment, same table , same hairline or hairdo, nothing fancy here  Just following SATOSHI!"
2024-12-05 16:56:50,"He's literally been watching it since 2013 when it was $100 and the 2024 video isn't in a mansion??? Wtf, He's either completely loaded and playing it down or he's made some very bad financial decisions up till now because that 2024 background is not doing it. 🙃"
2024-12-05 16:57:47,I wonder how much dude is worth at this point?
2024-12-05 16:57:48,Hope its follows his hairline

2024-12-05 17:03:00,Wouldn’t it be funny if he had no idea how the original video went.
2024-12-05 17:04:33,He's aging very well! Not as good as Bitcoin but still...
2024-12-05 17:05:53,"I'm so stoked to see this video, but it's really hard on my hangover"

2024-12-05 17:08:01,Aged like fine wine 🍷
2024-12-05 17:09:01,I'm more surprised his hairline hasn't changed in all this time!
2024-12-05 17:09:43,Looking good man! Those BTC gains cleared up the acne real quick.
2024-12-05 17:12:59,"Lol holy shit, it’s the actual guy. Very cool he’s still around. Must be fuckin loaded with coins"
2024-12-05 17:15:29,A buddy of mine back in 2011 tried to convince me to just throw a hundred dollars into bitcoin just for the hell of it and I talked him out of it.

2024-12-05 17:41:44,"Bro’s hairline game is strong af!! Wish I aged that well the past 11 years lmao. Legendary video though, awesome to see a follow up"
2024-12-05 17:42:34,He looks healthier no? Or maybe it just the camera back then was semi crap compared to todays.

2024-12-05 18:12:27,But absolute legend me always will be as long as I remember him
2024-12-05 18:14:09,"This is an amazing retrospective.  It also illustrates there's no maximum Bitcoin price  100,000 has always just been a number talked about during bull runs for the last 6 years.  Now they MUST use a million as the goal post  These targets themselves are meaningless. They really say nothing about what Bitcoin is.  I have always kicked myself because I used to have 25 bitcoins after it 28 x on my watch them I got stupid.  But guess what? I get another chance 😜 because it's gonna 28 x again   It should also be clear that outside of lucky gambling, HODL Bitcoin is the only smart play  It WILL price crash. Every bull run gets smashed. And someday, it WILL hit 3 million a coin."
2024-12-05 18:15:46,wow
2024-12-05 18:16:07,Why is he in the same room if he bought at $100????
2024-12-05 18:16:14,"Someone tipped me like 30 cents of bitcoin 10 years ago on reddit (that tipbot thing). I forgot about it, bitcoin was in the news so I found it and sold it for like $30 (wow, 100x gain!!). I don't want to know what it would be worth currently..."
2024-12-05 18:16:23,I can’t wait until 2035 for his next video
2024-12-05 18:17:56,You already know this guy is retired
2024-12-05 18:18:22,Wow      Wow
2024-12-05 18:18:32,The biggest shock is he still has the same monitor..
2024-12-05 18:19:22,I thought it was AI at first
2024-12-05 18:19:54,bahaha this is amazing 
2024-12-05 18:22:06,For reference. 1k in bitcoin in 2013 is worth 1mil today.   Insane.
2024-12-05 18:23:10,“Look at thiss grraAaAaappphh”.
2024-12-05 18:23:21,My guys hairline is also the highest it's ever been.
2024-12-05 18:25:19,I was going to buy 200 in 2011. My dad convinced me to put it into a roth ira...
2024-12-05 18:25:39,His forehead grows with the price of bitcoin
2024-12-05 18:26:42,"And just like last time, I lost 100% of my bitcoin 4 months before ATH."
2024-12-05 18:28:46,He should spend it all on pizza.
2024-12-05 18:29:23,"Rookie question: I bought $1,000 BTC (less fees) in 2021 and $4,000 (less fees) 2022 and left all funds in the Coinbase app. No trades or movement. I look up the ""If I bought BTC ... amt/date"" and it shows my value should be $9,000+ but I can't find that in the Coinbase app. I only see $5 or so as how much crypto I can trade.  Can anyone explain why?"
2024-12-05 18:31:55,"What is insane about it? He did it on purpose, lol, it wasn't like he magically happened to recreate his exact video from 11 years ago."
2024-12-05 18:32:14,same monitor but at least he bought a better camera
2024-12-05 18:32:23,Amazing. And with a sense of humility and humor.
2024-12-05 18:34:52,He will always be in to bitcoin 🤓
2024-12-05 18:37:03,username does not check out
2024-12-05 18:37:27,I sold my bitcoin when the Silk Road went under. I fucked up
2024-12-05 18:37:42,Wonder how much this dude made. He must be happy as fuck to be right all this time
2024-12-05 18:37:50,"Now, looking forward to the usd 1,000,000 video."
2024-12-05 18:39:37,CINEMA
2024-12-05 18:40:19,what a great video! holdling gives a smoother skin it seems.
2024-12-05 18:41:23,"Did he get rich? Because it's still in the same place today, you haven't bought any BTC?"
2024-12-05 18:41:31,"Man, I really wish that instead of learning my times tables in 2013 I was buying BTC with my allowance money…"
2024-12-05 18:42:31,11 years getting bald.
2024-12-05 18:42:39,Is it even worth getting into bitcoin now?
2024-12-05 18:43:04,Yup. Waiting for the $1.000.000 Video.
2024-12-05 18:43:46,He didn't lose that much hair.
2024-12-05 18:45:17,I remember laughing at a friend who told me to buy Bitcoin back when it was only 10 cents.
2024-12-05 18:45:48,Cant wait for the 'its all gone'
2024-12-05 18:46:28,This dude doesn’t change a thing. He’s content asf.
2024-12-05 18:46:52,How many does he have?
2024-12-05 18:47:15,Dude probably has more money than elon!

2024-12-05 18:56:33,i think he sell it all. table and monitor din't change at all.
2024-12-05 18:56:46,I feel like a schmuck for never buying
2024-12-05 19:00:16,Do it again when it hits a million!
2024-12-05 19:03:24,"I just left a subreddit where the conversation was that you had to be an absolute fucking idiot to put any money into crypto. I haven't made millions, but my $1000 has turned into $6000, now my kids are getting better Christmas presents than they expected. If it crashes tomorrow, lad is still getting that big ass Lego set. I suppose I'm probably still a fucking idiot, but like.... for other reasons."
2024-12-05 19:15:14,I thought you weren't going to compare
2024-12-05 19:15:37,"Damn, I knew I should have invested my life's fortune when I was 10. Look at me now just graduating college with a stupid paper. I'm so far behind!"
2024-12-05 19:16:33,This guy is awesome... the fact that bitcoin has done a 1000x and he's still riding with the same setup 😆😂
2024-12-05 19:16:56,This video is more emotional than any emotional hollywood movie in the world
2024-12-05 19:20:08,I’m starting to buy 20k of it every year
2024-12-05 19:20:12,Love this so much! I bought in shortly after his first video
2024-12-05 19:20:15,Can someone fill me in please?
2024-12-05 19:21:53,I really hope he bought & kept Bitcoin all this time.  OG for sure
2024-12-05 19:28:30,I remember some economists said years ago that bitcoin will reach 250k one day.
2024-12-05 19:29:23,2013 OG vs 2024 Remake
2024-12-05 19:32:16,why does he still look homeless?
2024-12-05 19:34:26,"What the fuck.. he didn’t age, at all ??  All that happened is his skin has improved massively lol"
2024-12-05 19:35:04,I have more confidence in his hairline that I do in Bitcoin
2024-12-05 19:36:36,Do it again at 1 mil
2024-12-05 19:38:37,I hope that dude is loaded at this point having bought in at less than $100...
2024-12-05 19:40:58,"hodling the hairline as well, I see"
2024-12-05 19:43:43,Hey it’s me buying a single bit coin in 2013 and buying weed with it on silphroad. Then it was the cheapest zip I ever smoked. Now it’s quite possibly the biggest bag drop I’ve ever done:(
2024-12-05 19:45:20,100k in 11 years means nothing
2024-12-05 19:47:42,Freakin legend bro
2024-12-05 19:50:15,That’s so crazy
2024-12-05 19:50:54,"Lol the man didn't change vernacular or lexicon one bit in 10 years...  astonishing levels of non development.  Of course maybe it's all an edit to attract attention, seems most likely, for his sake I hope so."
2024-12-05 19:51:06,Why is this guy not a multi billionaire
2024-12-05 19:54:06,You would think he'd have a bigger TV in the video on the right😄😄
2024-12-05 19:55:49,Legend
2024-12-05 19:58:38,"I wonder if he owns BTC, his setup  hasn't changed at all"
2024-12-05 20:03:00,Still poor?
2024-12-05 20:05:18,Still has the same monitor. Clearly didn’t hodl.
2024-12-05 20:05:18,"He didn’t take any profit , he lives in the same place with same monitor"
2024-12-05 20:09:19,You have a big job now.
2024-12-05 20:12:50,Surprised his hairline didn’t get any worse in 10 years 🤔   Had to have spent some of that on hair loss sups and treatment
2024-12-05 20:14:40,"Wow, he looks great."
2024-12-05 20:24:35,oh my... on the same hour
2024-12-05 20:25:14,Hope we alive to see next highs!! 🚀🚀🚀
2024-12-05 20:31:49,why did bro not take some gains? get yourself a bigger room and an new monitor at least
2024-12-05 20:31:54,I remember when btc was over 100k
2024-12-05 20:35:53,A spectacular scam with an updated image and better skin care. Dude is watching history unfold and is still at $100k.
2024-12-05 20:43:38,I don’t get it
2024-12-05 20:49:36,Did he ever switch it up?
2024-12-05 21:02:43,I have nothing but congratulations for those who saw this coming and had faith. 🙌🏾 I pray they become wealthy with millions!!
2024-12-05 21:06:38,How many bitcoins does he have now though??
2024-12-05 21:20:39,I'm missing the point on this. Why is this legendary?
2024-12-05 21:25:32,Hoping he's loaded haha
2024-12-05 21:25:48,when do you think he sold
2024-12-05 21:28:50,"just imagine, a dude watched 11 years bitcoin rise from $100 to $100,000 and still lives in a house on the roof"
2024-12-05 21:28:56,Guys looks like he’s 2 different races in each one like he looks mad darker in the second
2024-12-05 21:32:39,"Can Lamborghini even fill this many orders?  Dear lord boys, we're going to see them on Uber soon."
2024-12-05 21:37:24,Bro forgot to age
2024-12-05 21:39:11,Surprised
2024-12-05 21:45:37,"Its the eyes. The eyes of someone who saw a future of beauty, and like an old testament prophet trudged through years of hell to finally the promised land, and is now glows with radiant orange laser beams because he can see what glorious dawn is ahead."
2024-12-05 21:59:22,Crazy that his hairline hasn't receded any more in 11 years
2024-12-05 22:06:30,"I'll take ""power move"" for 1000 sats please trebek you pansy"
2024-12-05 22:06:35,Is this guy rich?
2024-12-05 22:09:11,I'm still surprised after 10 years dude has the exact same setup
2024-12-05 22:11:45,Dude is hopefully loaded
2024-12-05 22:22:02,So this guy's skin care regime is what
2024-12-05 22:22:38,This gives me hope i will never lose my hair
2024-12-05 22:24:52,No way that's fucking awesome!
2024-12-05 22:29:46,But his hairline going Down
2024-12-05 22:35:25,How is no one talking about that his screensaver with the time is exactly the same *to the second*?!

2024-12-05 23:00:53,Proof that both Bitcoin and men age well.
2024-12-05 23:04:54,Now do euros. We have gotten close today...
2024-12-05 23:13:57,Now you understand why speech patterns are excellent for identifying someone. Works with text and written letters as well.
2024-12-05 23:14:28,Vine days
2024-12-05 23:17:50,"That time stamp 15:02:24, that's gotta be fake right? No way everything is the same AND the time matches to the minute of the day... WTF?!?!?"
2024-12-05 23:23:45,I'm impressed by his hairline hodling at almost the same spot for 10 years.
2024-12-05 23:25:29,Ugh fuck you
2024-12-05 23:40:44,Hairline holding up is crazy!

2024-12-06 15:36:34,How much does this guy own in bitcoin? This is the real question here????
2024-12-06 16:03:16,"Wow thats crazy. Wish I bought bitcoin earlier. Maybe the top is around 100k this cycle, could see a pullback soon. But im glad I hold bitcoin now.  But a bit late to see massive gains, maybe next cycle. Very bullish longterm."

2025-02-07 01:57:50,Look how much better the video quality is! The monitor is better quality! Makes you wonder how this looks in another 10 years? Will he been a hologram in the next video?
2025-04-18 22:13:45,Can’t wait for the $1M bitcoin video
2024-12-05 17:06:07,"Bitcoin confirmed $1,000,000 2034???????????????????????????????????????????"

2024-12-05 17:54:53,Why show your face tho?  Clout ain't worth it at this point.
2024-12-05 20:40:57,That's what 1000x gains will do for someone.
2024-12-05 20:47:58,Meth vs cocaine
2024-12-05 21:54:29,Using the same set up though lmao
2024-12-06 10:38:41,Money will do that to you
2024-12-06 14:19:28,Or he just has makeup since its on a set this time instead of his house
2024-12-06 19:20:17,His skin care routine has to be studied.
2024-12-07 00:49:27,he looks like a teenager going through puberty. I’m not surprised he looks better after dealing with the puberty/acne. 
2024-12-08 02:19:25,That’s what money can buy lol
2024-12-08 17:57:56,The camera quality helps (technological advancement). Plus older with no acne. He looks the same to me minus acne. Lol
2024-12-05 18:38:26,Dude’s been hitting the plates bro.
2024-12-05 14:45:22,"This is just phenomenal that this dude made this update video.  Like you say, what a fucking legend."
2024-12-05 16:26:58,Holy shit... dude is still living in the same house. It's amazing. A true bitcoiner through and through.
2024-12-05 14:57:31,Hope he held some amazing
2024-12-05 19:58:01,He looks younger in 2024
2024-12-05 18:13:32,He has to do this again at 100 million.
2024-12-05 17:11:32,Yeah. He's one of the BTC enthusiasts I wish I had known earlier. What is his X handle
2024-12-05 18:31:22,"I like how it's clear that it was other people that made bank on his advice but that he never listened to himself. See the people that made millions buy buying once and holding for years, they never fucking say anything. Nobody knows about it. They keep their fucking mouth shut. The guys that are yapping, yapping, yapping, they are just pretending like they made it. But they missed the boat while being on it. Damn."
2024-12-05 18:09:05,who is he?
2024-12-05 18:46:03,What’s the peak for bitcoin?
2024-12-06 00:27:28,I just wanted to repeat.. WHAT AN ABSOLUTE LEDGER!
2024-12-06 00:43:13,Plus he looks great too. I must say.
2024-12-05 18:11:40,Almost as much of a legend as the guy who [revealed the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto](https://youtu.be/emDJTGTrEm0?si=YkD6DuBcWdwzV37u)
2024-12-05 15:03:13,Had the same thought.  Is it even the same little stand the monitor is on?  I hope this guy is rich as hell and just doesn’t do anything with it
2024-12-05 16:04:30,It's a set. Here's the full video: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1h71xyg/me\_reacting\_to\_bitcoin\_breaking\_100k\_in\_2024/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1h71xyg/me_reacting_to_bitcoin_breaking_100k_in_2024/)

2024-12-05 16:21:03,Fuck
2024-12-06 00:00:02,It's a set made by coinbase
2024-12-05 16:37:00,"yea, invest in bitcoin..."
2024-12-05 17:58:23,Lol i thought the same thing. Not his house its a reenactment on a stage set like in the movies coordinated by coin base
2024-12-06 14:27:47,He probably sold during that $100 ATH he was so excited about 😺
2024-12-06 14:49:25,Yeah he is holding cash... watch the full video with the reveal at the end.
2024-12-06 17:25:33,it was an identical set built by coinbase
2024-12-05 16:57:05,Nah he doesn’t. He obviously sold and pretends he has held. Look at his previous videos he’s a brokie
2024-12-05 21:06:17,"He went back, bought the house with his gains, just to make this video.     #legend. "
2024-12-05 14:54:01,100M in 11 years?

2024-12-05 17:04:34,Lowkey my guy had a pretty nice glowup.
2024-12-05 19:25:48,If you get wealthy you should get better looking. You can actually afford things to make you look good.
2024-12-05 16:57:47,He did not hold though obviously. Look at the videos he filmed before this he is in a crappy apartment and he just grifts and pretends he has held.
2024-12-05 16:58:21,That’s a 20 trillion dollar market cap. Not saying it can’t happen but seems kinda crazy.

2024-12-05 15:44:56,Millions easily. 15$ a week since then would have you at like over 40M now
2024-12-05 16:48:29,He already came out and said of course I Hodled

2024-12-05 18:39:49,look at the bitcoin price in Argentina or Lebanon. That's USD in 20 years or less
2024-12-05 19:15:23,"depends on whether i buy or not. i bought in 2022 ... and then it crashed a few months later. i held until october 2024, before selling at a loss because i needed money. you guys are welcome"

2024-12-05 18:42:28,"It wasn't as cool as it sounds. You woulda been obsessed day and night learning about it, imagining the future, and probably trying to start a bitcoin business, while ignoring your friends and family that want to see you. You wouldn't have a girlfriend because all you talk about is bitcoin, you are too cheap to buy them anything, and too tired working on your business to appear interesting to them.  Not like I know anything about that or whatever..."

2024-12-05 15:11:51,Enough to party
2024-12-05 16:36:38,I think the pattern means he won't post again until $100 million.

2024-12-05 21:41:32,Yet still can’t afford a decent desk.
2024-12-06 06:57:22,he finally can afford acne cream

2024-12-05 21:07:33,Actually he did an ama at some point and confirmed that he remained bullish and hodled and hodled and kept buying.
2024-12-05 19:56:10,It actually looks like the monitor is a little bigger. Right?
2024-12-05 15:07:38,The best kind of wealthy individual; the one that doesn’t show it off. Continues to live comfortably without overt vanity.
2024-12-05 15:18:15,It's a set recreated by Coinbase. Check his video on youtube you will see at the end.

2024-12-05 20:23:39,Probably recreated it. I highly doubt the setup is the same after a decade lol
2024-12-05 20:42:51,He went back and bought the apartment complex just for this video
2024-12-05 22:58:35,What's the point of being rich as hell and not doing anything with it?
2024-12-06 00:00:06,It's a set made by coinbase
2024-12-05 16:15:58,"It’s an coinbase ads but judging from his youtube channel he does hold, buying everything, every week, having a media company iirc. His videos are mostly rambling about questioning what he wanted to do with his life that is not about the money"

2024-12-05 17:38:58,Do you think everyone immediately buys a lambo when they have a million bucks? There are a lot of wealthy people who don’t show off like this.
2024-12-05 22:47:26,The fed prints $ bro. What was once 2 trillion will become the same thing as 20 trillion. Do you even bitcoin?
2024-12-05 17:10:25,If you don't think bitcoin can surpass gold; you dont really even
2024-12-06 00:21:24,that s what people said about bitcoin hitting 100 dollars.
2024-12-05 18:18:16,So bitcoin is how we unlock the finances to build space cities.
2024-12-05 19:27:36,It's just a matter of time. It just depends on how long. The US has a debt of 35 trillion. Who knows how high that'll be before I die.
2024-12-05 19:54:53,"Whether the market cap is 2, 20 or 200 trillion is pretty meaningless. There is no upper limit. Let's see what happens when a significantly larger portion of bitcoin owners want to cash in than to buy or hold. It's bound to happen at some point."

2024-12-06 02:20:43,"I'm well versed in these thoughts. But take solace in knowing that 1: You never would have dumped 15k into btc. AND 2: IF you actually did, you would have been glued to the price charts and stressing daily about it. You'd have sold when you had 100k or 50k or some such.   Almost no one accomplishes the dream scenario, usually they do it by accident. And then so many more have been simply lost.    I had Miners running that I built that were mining me about 1btc per month. I did ok, but ended up having to sell most at the worst time to life circumstances."

2024-12-06 14:25:24,Or perhaps because he isn't someone that gets acne anymore as often happens as people age and his camera is much nicer as is everyone's who owns a relatively recent smart phone?  Also maybe drinks more water? A thousand reasons and ya'll choose the most consumerist sentiment.

2024-12-05 15:31:41,It really is the only way to get wealthy and remain wealthy.
2024-12-05 20:12:29,This.  It’s so fucking funny to me when I hear family talk about “so-and-so is so rich they did X-Y-Z”  They have no idea I make $1M a year and am the richest person they know. I hear those stories and know that person is fake rich. Spending a shit load to appear like they can afford it.
2024-12-05 17:20:13,Wealthy individuals that spend their money do more for the rest of society. Holding wealth just hurts everyone.

2024-12-05 16:49:25,People said this before about Bitcoin hitting 100k. Dollar is less valuable but not worthless. Bitcoin appreciates faster than dollar inflates.
2024-12-05 17:11:20,The US Dollar is not worthless. Considering it is created by changing the value of a bit on a chip from 0 to 1 it has an energy cost of 1*10^-15 Joules. I Joule is 1/3600000 of a KWH and one KWH has a value of $0.01683. So doing the math then we end up with the real value of a dollar at:   $0.000000000000000000004675
2024-12-05 20:44:53,the dollar will increase because all has been supplied to bitcoin and you got less in the real world. therefore selling your bitcoin gives more worth
2024-12-08 05:47:37,"there's only about 80 trillion dollars and 20 million Bitcoin, so it can't really be worth more than 4 million, right?"
2024-12-05 16:53:39,If bitcoin hit 10M it would be worth multiple times more money than exists on earth
2024-12-05 18:13:27,The dollar is already worthless. The house of cards is falling
2024-12-05 17:13:42,Then he wouldn’t be filming vids like this

The exchange was sold to the company in Japan the printed the cards, and instead of dealing with currency issues, the company decided three packs of cards would be worth one coin of pretend internet money.  This is how Bitcoin became worth predictable, reliable $20-25 hard currency cash.  From there, blockchain experts and online exchange consultants ran with the idea that massive international financial sophistication was inevitable.  And some people on Silk Road had more ideas on how to justify higher prices.  But here's an important clue to pay attention to:  To this day I have not met any kids who saved BTC.  They turned it all into cold, hard MtG cards with actual value.  Anybody out there know anybody with BTC from before 2013?"

2024-12-06 00:34:02,I feel like its the very definition of being wealthy and being rich. Just like the difference between living and existing
2024-12-05 19:14:02,This couldn't be further from the truth. Very aspiring bourgeoisie mentality here.
2024-12-05 17:27:02,Difference I’m emphasizing is between spending money and flaunting it (*overt vanity*)
2024-12-05 17:41:02,Most won’t ever get to wealthy status though because they’re poor and flaunting what they don’t have.

2024-12-05 20:49:07,"Giving away money, is not the way to improve the world. Think about it.

2024-12-05 19:52:25,"I think it's more about 100M * 20M = 2000T, while the total amount of money in the world is about 100T. So Bitcoin can't mathematically reach that kind of valuation without some unrelated macroeconomic event. This either requires the dollar to become worthless or world productivity to increase immensely."

2024-12-07 22:13:05,That's a good point. I wasn't thinking about the sheer scale of 100M a coin.
2025-01-20 09:35:42,So if total money in the world is 100T that would mean that about 2% of the worlds money is currently in Bitcoin. That's pretty dope.
2024-12-05 21:19:17,Who said 100m? What are you talking about?
2024-12-07 02:50:50,"Money is an imaginary agreement. All of it. From gold to dollars to BTC. Its value is entirely dependent on how much we give it.  Milk and eggs and bread and labor are real things, money is just a symbol for the transfer of value."

2024-12-05 18:26:51,"Yes people can make all those financially sensible choices making $7.25 an hour. Go ahead try to live off of only the minimum wage for a while and see how it feels.

They PREY on poor people who just need any job they can to get by. Can't wait to hear how you're about to blame poor people for being poor and in such a situation."

I suspect someone has figured out how to crack the earliest key generation methods, finding some flaw, reducing the compute time to something feasible and so every once in a while an address whose original owners lost track of it ages ago is exploited.  The real whale is of course Satoshi’s addresses…."

2025-07-04 08:52:03,He waited to finalize his divorce sonje didn’t have to give 50% away. Then it’s easy to hodl.
2025-07-04 09:21:50,"In 2011, Bitcoin’s circulating supply was around 6–8 million BTC, and 10,000 BTC would’ve represented roughly 0.13–0.17% of it. At that time, such a stack could be acquired through mining, buying on Mt. Gox for \~$7,800, or participating in early dev or darknet activities. It was challenging, but not impossible for early adopters, libertarian techies, or Silk Road players.  Bunch of red flags here - the wallet held exactly 10,000 BTC untouched for 14 years; no test transactions, no movement until now. That kind of cold storage discipline is rare, especially for early adopters who often lost keys, panicked, or partially sold. If NSA created Btc then only they can be so nonchalant.  1. Satoshi or Early Dev Wallet. The exact 10,000 BTC and no movement for 14 years resemble early Satoshi-era behavior. It could belong to Hal Finney, Martti Malmi, or someone directly tied to Bitcoin’s origin. 2. Government Seizure Wallet. The wallet might be linked to a silent government seizure - possibly from Silk Road or BTC-e now being moved quietly to liquidate or fund operations. 3. Nation-State Sleeper Whale. A foreign government or intelligence-linked group may have acquired and held the stash as a strategic reserve, now activated to fund war efforts or financial disruption. 4. Dead Man’s Switch or Timed Unlock. The coins could have been programmed to move automatically after a set time, triggered by inactivity, BTC price targets, or the original owner's death. 5. Ross Ulbriht, doing some housekeeping chores. Silk Road launched in February 2011, but went viral in June after a Gawker article exposed it as a darknet marketplace for drugs. That exposure triggered a surge in users and helped drive BTC’s price from \~$2 to \~$30 over the summer. Said BTC were acquired in April 2011. Could Ross receive first payments in just first 4 months after the launch and total more then $7.8k? Shouldn't be that hard. But hold it through all these years even during imprisonment?  6. Zaddy Donny wants to buy a big gift to america for upcoming birthday."

2025-07-04 11:56:21,I try not to think about the single bitcoin that my late friend sent me around that time just to show me how it worked. It would be amazing if I stumbled across the wallet information but I'm not holding out hope. I'm not even sure I saved it anywhere because the whole process seemed so ridiculous at the time.
2025-07-04 08:12:28,Sounds like a dark netter that got out of jail
2025-07-04 08:52:17,That you Ross? Finally accessed his prison wallet now that he’s free.
2025-07-04 08:14:01,Is this the Silk Road guy finally moving his satoshi stash?

2025-07-04 09:34:05,These ppl r probably either super wealthy or they forgot about or something.  Yea in hindsight it's great. But not cashing some when it's in the millions is bad for the average joe.  The ppl who sold early and have ptsd. Is because they sold all.

2025-07-04 11:54:24,What happens to the money now if he's a person from the US ? Is he going to get taxed on it ? Is he going to say Bitcoin when asked where the money came from ?
2025-07-04 12:20:27,Even  moved the whole amount in a single transaction

2025-07-04 13:44:14,It doesn’t if you believe in it. Though I will say 100k BTC price seems like a sell
2025-07-04 13:57:34,Ugh. His moment of euphoria after selling will immediately be killed by the realization of how much taxes he owes on 0 cost basis.    But lucky for him what he’ll have left is still a fortune.

2025-07-04 14:24:42,"He probably had more and sold it sooner, but just kept some stashed away to see if it would keep going up.   No poor or middle class person isn't cashing out SOME of it the moment they can make double their annual salary.  We need money.   Also, I'm dumb.  How did someone buy Bitcoin in 2011?  Everyone kicks themself for not doing it, but I legit feel like I wouldn't have known how to even do it before the platforms existed."

2025-07-04 17:18:08,"I know, right? That's only a 14,000,000% ROI, barely beats inflation."
2025-07-04 17:27:42,Kidnapping team dispatched.
2025-07-04 18:24:00,Did he actually sell or just move wallets?
2025-07-04 18:28:09,Did he transfer or sell? Who just has 1B in cash laying around to buy it? Are exchanges that liquid? Apologies if it’s a noob question.
2025-07-04 18:57:26,I like how he waited until he was over a billion. Now he is on Mario’s brothers list.
2025-07-04 18:58:09,This person is the exception to billionaires shouldn’t exist.
2025-07-04 18:59:16,Maybe he finally found the hard drive in the landfill?
2025-07-04 19:07:57,Proof he sold? No proof. Moved his coins. That's it. You're spreading bullshit fear

2025-07-04 20:20:40,Sold or just moved to another wallet?
2025-07-04 21:02:46,Why today tho?
2025-07-04 21:08:32,I highly doubt this was his only wallet.
2025-07-04 21:33:45,Had to be waiting for all his accounts in El Salvador to be 1000% secure before flipping and paying 0% tax.

2025-07-05 19:01:42,"He was in jail may be,most of the old wallet belongs to the guys who were involved in activities like drugs through silk road and other darkweb forums. So most of these guys after getting jailed are forced to HODL and then cashing out big chunk after the release."

2025-07-09 14:07:43,It’s so sickening to believe.. I didn’t know about bitcoin till I’m not sure when but it was already suuuper expensive. In 2011 my house burnt down and my dad and little brother both got 3rd degree burns on over 50% of their bodies.. I was left homeless at 16.. i turned to drugs to drown out the things I witnessed that day.. if I would’ve known I could’ve invested a measly  8 dollars and been a millionaire today.. I just wish I would’ve known…

2025-07-04 09:46:46,Could it be some dude that managed to crack the secret key to a dormant account? That would bring bitcoin down.
2025-07-04 08:08:00,Congratulations 🙌 well deserved.

2025-07-04 10:41:09,Satoshi is back?
2025-07-04 10:44:43,"I've been all in on crypto for 7 years, and I'm over 50% down. I think I'm doing it wrong."
2025-07-04 10:45:15,Maybe they found their hardware device finally.
2025-07-04 10:45:40,I think he just lost his password for a bit
2025-07-04 10:46:51,I wonder how many of these sleeping whales without test transactions are actually hacked wallets...
2025-07-04 10:47:29,"You mean ""this agent."""
2025-07-04 10:47:45,Finally remembered his password
2025-07-04 10:48:55,Dude sent 1 transaction without even a test one. Just one clear shot
2025-07-04 10:51:23,How did he sell 1B on an exchange? Did someone buy it in one go? I need to know logistics of selling 10K bitcoin...asking for a friend.
2025-07-04 10:53:01,bullish
2025-07-04 10:53:47,Dude can he be my friend I need some help
2025-07-04 10:54:00,You know this dude was sitting on this money until he got fed up with whatever he was doing
2025-07-04 10:54:28,Trump pardoned Ross Ulbricht.
2025-07-04 10:54:58,"No legit  deal that big is an all cash, convert 10000 bitcoin, type of deal"
2025-07-04 10:57:16,"Patience, is it's own reward, remember that before you panic sell, especially when you know you invested in a good project. Any ""noise"" must be ignored, keep your eye on the end goal."
2025-07-04 11:00:07,that has GOT to be time traveller 100%
2025-07-04 11:00:47,Now depreciating fast
2025-07-04 11:01:47,Ross sends his regards
2025-07-04 11:03:03,he said im gonna put a time lock on this and have auto tranfer after 14 years for my kids lol
2025-07-04 11:05:44,Great for him.   (Could have been me if I listened to my nerdy cousin who owns two fucking Houses now)
2025-07-04 11:06:07,Good for him.
2025-07-04 11:06:44,Ross that you?
2025-07-04 11:08:33,"How the hell do you even off ramp that amount? Presumably you convert to a stable coin and then drop feed out into USD/fiat?   Also I would imagine one would want to do this in a ""tax friendly"" jurisdiction"
2025-07-04 11:09:16,Bro was like time to not be broke anymore.
2025-07-04 11:09:51,"Actually just moved to different wallets, and probably sold some."
2025-07-04 11:13:01,"Pardon my ignorance, but where do you see those transfers? And how do you know they belong to the same person?"
2025-07-04 11:14:32,"God damn, that could have been me ;_;"
2025-07-04 11:15:10,This was on my start page. Serious question. Where could you possibly get $1bn? Is it a bank? How long would it take until the money is in your bank account? And how long do you think it would take for authorities to question where the money came from?
2025-07-04 11:15:18,Hes wildin
2025-07-04 11:15:33,Anyone remember Quazarcoin?
2025-07-04 11:16:33,Governemtn gonna take 50% of that on taxes
2025-07-04 11:17:16,"Yeah... I still remember mining 8 BTC per night on my AMD Radeon 6950, and then selling them for 0.80€ each the next day and thinking ""I'm fucking rich!"".  Of course, I didn't keep my 100's of BTC.... when you don't have money, your tolerance to loss is non-existent."
2025-07-04 11:17:40,You know how they say that nobody becomes a billionaire without harming a bunch of people... Is this the one exception?
2025-07-04 11:17:47,Mad respect for playing the long game.
2025-07-04 11:18:26,This is probably the most depressing post I've ever seem on reddit.
2025-07-04 11:19:25,California got into the wallet little early eh?
2025-07-04 11:20:56,Really speaks to its viability as a currency when it's most celebrated when people convert it to USD
2025-07-04 11:21:42,Honest question: where does the money come from when you sell this much? It’s not like most/major banks take crypto or even carry that much cash around. Is there some central crypto account where everyone s money is kept?
2025-07-04 11:25:44,Are these dormant accounts or accounts which are getting pass-key guessed?
2025-07-04 11:29:08,"Kinda makes me nervous to see a sale this big. Like, why did he sell? Does he know something? I guess a billion is good enough."
2025-07-04 11:29:23,We all wish we had a crystal ball and grabbed some back then.
2025-07-04 11:29:29,If only I wasn’t busy learning multiplication back then.
2025-07-04 11:29:49,This person is living his life now. 1 Billion USD is crazy.
2025-07-04 11:31:39,"What upsets me the most is that I was totally alive 14 years ago and an adult with a job and able to do this, even to a smaller extent. Good for them."
2025-07-04 11:33:08,Inhuman self control and patience. Or dude was probably in jail.
2025-07-04 11:33:22,Weren’t 2 different wallets activated? Could be 2 billion
2025-07-04 11:34:46,I remember back in school days 2011. Got my i7 2600k and radeon hd 6970 and mine a couple of bitcoins every day. But in lack of money at that time in school i got a free wallet on bitcoinpool.com  That turned out not be that free after all. The owner of that site took all bitcoins from every user and closed the website.   Last message i got from that website was 4 mars 2012 that it had an dns error. Lots of bitcoins lost that day.
2025-07-04 11:36:58,How do you turn this into $1 billion cash? Which exchange has that much cash?
2025-07-04 11:38:29,We found the first successful case of someone time travelling
2025-07-04 11:38:33,Good deal
2025-07-04 11:38:36,I can’t imagine one day just getting 1B into my bank lol
2025-07-04 11:39:08,Will the world ever see anything like this again i wonder.
2025-07-04 11:39:17,Wow thats the cleanest wallet history ever. In-n-out
2025-07-04 11:42:18,Good thing he didn't spend them all on groceries
2025-07-04 11:42:29,does that say 1 billion?
2025-07-04 11:42:38,silkroad guy
2025-07-04 11:43:16,Hope he sold ut for € instead of dollars because that b*tch about to go down
2025-07-04 11:43:50,That’s a corporation
2025-07-04 11:44:36,He found his USB in the dump
2025-07-04 11:46:05,Homie waited for that third coma then bounced
2025-07-04 11:46:38,Imagine the dude who threw them away in the dump lol
2025-07-04 11:47:29,He was in coma and just wake up
2025-07-04 11:47:45,Wow. One question though... How can someone bridge that into fiat?
2025-07-04 11:48:14,It can't be as simple as just $1B straight into a bank account right? Would there have been any financial institutions involved here? And is 10k Bitcoin really that liquid?
2025-07-04 11:49:08,"Time traveller.  Bailout guys, this is the top."
2025-07-04 11:49:40,Hell of a tax bill
2025-07-04 11:50:37,"Why sold, he just moved it. Lol"
2025-07-04 11:51:11,Will he be taxed on it though?
2025-07-04 11:52:56,It’s Fry from Futurama.
2025-07-04 11:53:26,He probably just forgot about it
2025-07-04 11:57:18,1Billy ...he needs to post in wsb gain porn. The ultimate gain porn.
2025-07-04 11:59:03,I hate that bitcoin actually became a thing lol
2025-07-04 11:59:44,How does one cash that out?
2025-07-04 12:01:59,Seeing 1.09B almost looks like a video game. One of them incremental games.
2025-07-04 12:03:33,"It should show $7,800 because while thats nothing to a billionaire, it was quite a lot on a completely speculative and new form of investment!"
2025-07-04 12:04:42,Peter Thiel is getting out before ai takes it over.
2025-07-04 12:06:40,Someone in this or the bitcoin community bought his coins at a historical loss
2025-07-04 12:06:48,Everybody sell now!!
2025-07-04 12:06:55,r/screenshotfrauds
2025-07-04 12:07:36,so after tax whats he getting?
2025-07-04 12:09:18,Fair enough. Wow
2025-07-04 12:09:19,Good luck withdrawing that in fiat.
2025-07-04 12:09:25,Bought a gram of weed for 1 btc back on the day
2025-07-04 12:10:48,He waited until he could enjoy the tres commas club. baller
2025-07-04 12:11:52,Easy to remain patient when your in jail
2025-07-04 12:15:28,So the dump guy finally found his hard drive 
2025-07-04 12:15:54,"Diamond hands, people. It works."
2025-07-04 12:19:08,What about the fork airdrop like BCH and others?
2025-07-04 12:19:57,How would this work from a taxation standpoint though?
2025-07-04 12:26:16,"You will not see another 10,000x from this point if you just wait 14 years. It’s not that easy."
2025-07-04 12:27:49,The start of the crash. All the OGs are starting to sell out.
2025-07-04 12:28:10,The real question is did he keep delivering pizza knowing he’s gonna be rich?
2025-07-04 12:29:43,Who is buying that amount?
2025-07-04 12:29:55,"This money , how does one gets it in thier bank account ?"
2025-07-04 12:31:06,Time traveler detected!
2025-07-04 12:31:11,https://i.redd.it/3ztn14tq2vaf1.gif  Now those are diamond hands!
2025-07-04 12:31:13,"Where did you see he sold, it seems he just moved them, didn’t checked the whole transaction 🤷‍♂️"
2025-07-04 12:32:41,It is not patience
2025-07-04 12:32:47,Can I get some?
2025-07-04 12:36:45,He had 10k in 2011 to blow on Bitcoin. He obviously wasn't hurting for money.
2025-07-04 12:37:30,he could buy every reddit user a top-end pc and an island
2025-07-04 12:42:04,Darpa insider? :)
2025-07-04 12:42:41,Stupid question here.  Who is he selling to that just has 1 billion lying around?
2025-07-04 12:47:31,That’s gonna be a fun tax season for them
2025-07-04 12:52:06,Bitcoin is an ecologically expensive crime engine
2025-07-04 12:53:18,"god...what i'd give for a single btc...it'd solve all my problems, every single one of them"
2025-07-04 12:53:51," ,"
2025-07-04 12:54:29,definitely a time traveller. this guy knew
2025-07-04 12:55:58,Waste mans
2025-07-04 12:56:03,Waiting on that tax break
2025-07-04 12:57:24,That dude has to be a time traveler.
2025-07-04 12:57:52,must be hard to get 1bil out into your bank so
2025-07-04 12:58:34,i remember a story about a guy going thru a landfill because he or his wife accidentally threw away a hard drive with BTC on it     you reckon he found it? LOL
2025-07-04 13:00:17,I wonder what they look like. Cause i dont believe it was one man
2025-07-04 13:03:12,My friend has a couple physical bitcoins from 2013 her ex gave her. Each with one bitcoin on it.
2025-07-04 13:04:22,Humans are dumb
2025-07-04 13:06:07,I'm happy he finally found his hard drive in the field
2025-07-04 13:06:49,Was it hacked or someone got out of prison?
2025-07-04 13:09:07,"Spare some change, kind sir?"
2025-07-04 13:10:47,It's Ross Ulbright
2025-07-04 13:12:15,Have to cash out of the Ponzi scheme at some point.
2025-07-04 13:12:24,It’s Magic  Edit: the Gathering
2025-07-04 13:14:10,Imagine the feeling of freedom he felt once he clicked “sell”.
2025-07-04 13:14:39,It's Elon...
2025-07-04 13:15:12,Maybe he knows about an upcoming crash
2025-07-04 13:15:28,Time traveler spotted! 
2025-07-04 13:15:48,"That's awesome, people will applaud this as being smart, I'll die on the hill that it's not. It's lucky, not smart.I mean it's cool if you don't need any of your wealth for 14 years, or if you don't care if it goes to zero.  But that guys got a billion where common sense would have made him 100 billion."
2025-07-04 13:16:59,Ho-ly-shit
2025-07-04 13:17:58,"He probably plays RuneScape, they used to take bitcoin at that time tons of gold sellers are rich now lol"
2025-07-04 13:17:58,Unlikely patience- more likely super wealthy and just hasn’t needed it. This person was/and is- not hurting for money.
2025-07-04 13:18:13,Diamond hands
2025-07-04 13:18:27,we found the time traveller!!
2025-07-04 13:19:25,Probably already rich af and bought some at some charity job.
2025-07-04 13:21:17,"14 years ain’t shit.  I spent how many years getting degrees, certifications, vocational training for side gigs, getting loans for all that shit and busting my ass at 2 jobs during it all.     This makes me want to jump off a bridge."
2025-07-04 13:21:52,"Total outsider who is peripherally aware of crypto stuff since Bitcoin was announced. Who would back this if someone wanted to turn this into actual cash? Is it genuinely possible? I get the idea of moving around 1s and 0s, but I can't wrap my head around actually using this. Gotta be someone who basically trades in large amounts right?"
2025-07-04 13:22:20,Diamond hands!
2025-07-04 13:22:42,A Billionaire? I wonder which one of us they're going to rape and then use that money to avoid jail time with?
2025-07-04 13:23:02,Crypto final boss.
2025-07-04 13:23:03,What's the rate of return after exchange and gas prices
2025-07-04 13:23:05,My question is 14 years ago where and how did you securely store your Bitcoin?
2025-07-04 13:24:00,"If this person is a normie, there's absolutely no way any government will let him/her have that much cash. So  how would they get this money into a bank and start using it. Obviously they wouldn't be able to transfer a billion to a bank, but they'd have to do it a few million at a time?"
2025-07-04 13:26:02,What’s the tax on that if he pocketed it?
2025-07-04 13:27:08,Pretty sure he just got out of jail and didnt hodl intentionally lol
2025-07-04 13:29:15,A good day for a couple goons with wrenches in an abandoned warehouse.
2025-07-04 13:31:06,"Why is he using old addresses, and not segwit/taproot?"
2025-07-04 13:33:42,So after tax he'll have how much?
2025-07-04 13:34:27,Maybe he lost the USB stick the wallet keys were on.
2025-07-04 13:39:56,I don’t think I’d have the balls to transfer all that money at once lol. What a fucking psycho.
2025-07-04 13:40:32,Someone’s prison sentence really paid off
2025-07-04 13:41:11,"It’s far less impressive if he had 100,000 originally."
2025-07-04 13:42:43,"Could have been me , instead I got a bunch of overpriced drugs on the OG silkroad."
2025-07-04 13:43:18,"In 2011, aged 18, I won €500 in a Halloween costume competition. I remember seeing something on Facebook about bitcoin and thinking ""huh, imagine if I bought some now with my €500 and then I got money from it in the future!"" Unfortunately I am not tech savvy at all, so I couldn't figure out how to *actually* buy it, and I spent the €500 on a wacom bamboo drawing tablet, and a paintballing session for an ex boyfriends birthday.   How different my life could have been🥲 🤷🏼‍♀️"
2025-07-04 13:43:38,Ha
2025-07-04 13:43:49, Time to sell?
2025-07-04 13:43:54,Awesome
2025-07-04 13:48:05,this transfers fee prolly more than my whole btc all together xD
2025-07-04 13:48:07,"I heard somewhere that that Max guy used to gift people 10,000 BTC. Like he gave Steve Bannon 10,000 BTC on a laptop and Bannon said he lost it.   God I hope it’s not Bannon. I could see him lying about losing it for tax reasons…"
2025-07-04 13:52:37,Its not easy to just sell that much bitcoin.  Its going to be a long process of selling that will take years
2025-07-04 13:55:07,"Jesus, I would have sold it when Bitcoin hit $400."
2025-07-04 13:55:34,How does this work? Does the new address align to wallet if the person who bought the bitcoin or is that the address of an exchange where they’re then sold
2025-07-04 13:56:14,"Even went out of their way to move the 10k BCH as well, true OG Bitcoiner right there!"
2025-07-04 13:59:08,How do you transfer that to your bank account ? How does that even work
2025-07-04 13:59:48,🫡
2025-07-04 14:00:29,This should be in a news
2025-07-04 14:01:25,"Who invests 10k Dollars into Bitcoin back in 2011, that's not your average pal for sure."
2025-07-04 14:01:35,How sure are we that this is not the pre mine of satoshi?
2025-07-04 14:03:19,Unbelievable
2025-07-04 14:05:10,I shouldn't be writing this in a crypto forum. But what exactly did he do to deserve this valuation for the pizza. How about the next pizza guy putting the same effort in making pizza. Is it just luck(gambling).
2025-07-04 14:07:25,People post these wins online and then the crowd comes invest in meme coins and getting rich quick tokens. Eventually to complaint that crypto is a scam
2025-07-04 14:08:11,*The IRS would like to know your location.*
2025-07-04 14:08:39,My nephew bought a fake id for 10 btc when it was 20 bucks a coin.
2025-07-04 14:09:18,Ok but how much tax is he paying on this? Dude probably went from  billionaire to millionaire in 1 day cuz of the IRS
2025-07-04 14:10:05,100% lost the drive and just found it in a drawer while cleaning up.
2025-07-04 14:10:22,Jail is a great way to hodl
2025-07-04 14:11:29,It’s well deserved patience. He could wait for it to rise more… but u can do a lot with $1 billion
2025-07-04 14:11:38,Fake
2025-07-04 14:12:04,Good timing. Next year the IRS starts getting cost basis information!
2025-07-04 14:16:08,You guys always assume its patience. I assume he just lost the keys or didn't know how to sell until now lol.
2025-07-04 14:16:23,Perfect timing to be a 1%er
2025-07-04 14:18:20,I wonder did he forget about it
2025-07-04 14:21:04,Welp is this the top?
2025-07-04 14:22:36,The BTC that is on the move today appears to be from a single miner from 2011  they consolidated 180 mined reward blocks a few hops back. They had an address with 200k BTC in it at one point in 2011 (would be $22B today) which is a top 5 wallet ever
2025-07-04 14:24:28,Or maybe he just dusted off his old hard drives and struck gold
2025-07-04 14:26:57,dude was living inside a bunker
2025-07-04 14:27:57,Won’t he miss the run up to BTC $1 million?
2025-07-04 14:30:22,State.
2025-07-04 14:31:05,R. Ver
2025-07-04 14:31:11,This is insane
2025-07-04 14:32:02,Back then it was seen as a currency disrupter. Now it’s mostly just money laundering as it’s not proven to be any more useful than fiat but it has proven to be harder to track.
2025-07-04 14:32:16,Why now?
2025-07-04 14:36:09,How much tax is this guy gonna pay ?
2025-07-04 14:38:08,The war keeps dragging on and could cause a large liquidity dip. They probably feel the uncertain risks outweigh the possible reward. And going from a few grand to enough to not worry about vs going back isn't worth it to them.
2025-07-04 14:41:32,Confirmed btc is dead. If he pulled out its at the peak 🫡
2025-07-04 14:41:48,He's gotta be a time traveler
2025-07-04 14:42:11,Can I have some?
2025-07-04 14:44:43,I’m sorry correct me if I’m readying this wrong but does that say bought for $0 sold for $1.09 billion dollars??
2025-07-04 14:44:48,"Real question, how do you sell $1b worth of Btc? Do you have to reach out to an exchange and make a plan?"
2025-07-04 14:44:48,The fact you can move $1B in the click of a button without intermediaries is why bitcoin is superior

2025-07-04 14:50:42,"Someone take me out of my misery. Why didn’t I buy a home, APPL, and bitcoin when I was 9!? What an idiot, I am."
2025-07-04 14:51:01,i would kept some
2025-07-04 14:52:07,Leaning towards a theory supporting it's Ross Ulbricht or a time traveler
2025-07-04 14:52:09,"Ok I gotta' ask.     Im from totally outside this community, my knowledge of bitcoin is extremely lacking, but I've often heard about people finding a thumbdrive with bitcoin on it and such. I guess my question is ""If they can be worth literally a billion, how are they not getting faked/hacked? Secure is one thing, but so secure that it's not worth a criminal setting up a 500 million dollar scheme dedicated to the sole purpose of coding fake bitcoins onto something the size of a thumb drive? for a billion dollars or more?  Im probably coming across pretty ignorant right now, but google is absolutely no help with trying to figure this one out, it just tries to sell me it or gives me an AI tangent lol."
2025-07-04 14:52:14,"Damn, I remember thinking about buying some back then. Had hardly any spare cash so didn’t. lol"
2025-07-04 14:52:30,He was waiting for the big beautiful bill
2025-07-04 14:56:47,"When you already have wealth, this becomes easy. If you think this was some average Joe you’re kidding yourself"
2025-07-04 15:01:35,"I bought $20 worth of Bitcoin in 2014 or so. Left it on a old PC I left at my parents house  Never really thought about until recently. Asked my Mom and Dad who've always been really religious what happened to it and I guess after I moved out they burned all of my electronics for fear of the devil.  So, could always be worse."

2025-07-04 15:05:43,Diamond hands? nah Black hole hands not even light is living those hands
2025-07-04 15:06:20,That's a transfer not a sale
2025-07-04 15:10:48,Incredible patience - 14 years in crypto is an eternity. Maybe he was on a very long holiday
2025-07-04 15:12:46,"You sure he didn’t die and that’s an estate attorney selling, post step-up? I know I’d rather borrow as much as I could rather than pay LTCG on a windfall like that."
2025-07-04 15:15:19,Bro If I just got 1 billion dollars my brain is spinning thinking of the possibilities.
2025-07-04 15:15:29,"This guy probably had multiple addresses, and he didn't wait that long to take profit. "
2025-07-04 15:19:17,.
2025-07-04 15:20:45,"that's Saudi money oh shit I mean oil money, crazyy"
2025-07-04 15:21:58,"Seems strange to me the sale being done only to one wallet (as one buyer), am i missing something?"
2025-07-04 15:26:04,Sold or moved?
2025-07-04 15:29:32,bro finally found his hard drive
2025-07-04 15:31:31,Can they actually realize these gains? How is this actually going to hit their bank account?
2025-07-04 15:33:34,Dude just got out of prison. That was forced patience.
2025-07-04 15:34:55,"There’s been 6 transactions like this today, something big is brewing"
2025-07-04 15:42:20,Or he could’ve been in jail or something this whole time and just got out… heard a story a few years back of a similar scenario..
2025-07-04 15:42:26,Drug dealer who just got out of jail after serving 10 years
2025-07-04 15:45:59,Irs 👀
2025-07-04 15:49:30,"Bro 14 years is nothing. Most venture funds are 12-14 years in total.   It’s resisting the undeniable urge to sell at every new ATH that’s impressive, not the length of the hold!"
2025-07-04 15:51:27,Must be time traveler
2025-07-04 15:51:44,What ia this site called where we can see this info? Sorry i am new to this crypto world
2025-07-04 15:53:51,"Somebody found their password to their wallet, what a happy day for them"
2025-07-04 15:57:58,This is the guy we all could have been
2025-07-04 15:58:46,How do you know it's a sell?
2025-07-04 16:06:08,My bad i was trickshotting back on cod in 2011 so it couldnt of been me
2025-07-04 16:06:43,"Well this is he end, might as well sell"
2025-07-04 16:06:49,"And had almost 10k to ""waste"" on cryptocurrency in 2010 lmao"
2025-07-04 16:20:56,I would like to congratulate that person on finally being able to escape the rat race. I hope they are able to have a long and happy life.
2025-07-04 16:25:54,"He didn’t sell, he transferred it."
2025-07-04 16:26:33,I feel like they forgot about it and found their secret phrase after all this time.
2025-07-04 16:29:31,Satoshi???
2025-07-04 16:31:31,USD 1.09B.  Whoa..  So.. where does that $ 1 billion and change come from and go?  Into a bitcoin wallet or into a checking account.  The logistics are mindboggling.
2025-07-04 16:31:46,Thats bullshit and fake  You really think there is someone who made 1B dollars?  Illuminati will get to him before it happens
2025-07-04 16:38:15,🙏 God I have seen what you have done for others....
2025-07-04 16:44:09,"Well done man, congrats. You made right choices in right time, 14 years ago. Enjoy now."
2025-07-04 16:46:32,He found the one piece
2025-07-04 16:47:23,"Could he move to a country with little to no income tax, cash out, then move back to a higher tax region? If he cashed this out in America, he'd basically be paying $200M in taxes lol. Also"
2025-07-04 16:47:54,Sold too early 😂😂😂
2025-07-04 16:52:36,He was like .. yahh I'll take my gains when I'm officially over a billion.
2025-07-04 16:53:38,What are the chances he forgot he had it
2025-07-04 16:58:23,The ultimate balls to do that without a test transfer first...or perhaps the 1 billion is the test transfer?
2025-07-04 17:04:58,$7800 to $1.1 Billion is absolutely Bonkers !
2025-07-04 17:11:20,Damn this bro skipped the millionaire part and become an instant billionaire 😯
2025-07-04 17:12:34,whelp. its officially i will never be as rich as this guy. lmao wtffff 1b in a single transaction is wilddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd
2025-07-04 17:14:19,Bro was probably loaded before that
2025-07-04 17:15:23,The copium in the comments here is amazing.
2025-07-04 17:17:11,"And you dipshits are all still acting like it's ""real"" therefore he's rich, for doing nothing. It's amazing how much collective delusion pays off these days."
2025-07-04 17:17:27,What’s interesting is selling after 14 years to convert to a billion dollars. It means you think dollars will be worth more than bitcoin from here no? Otherwise why sell your bitcoin. I would think most people own bitcoin as a hedge against the dollar.
2025-07-04 17:17:28,"It was a group or origination. A total of 50,000 bitcoins over the age of 10 years old moved today."
2025-07-04 17:19:39,"Just out of curiosity, he sold it for just over a billion dollars but it's all on paper. So where did he sell it? How does he get the money to his bank? I doubt someplace like Kraken or Coinbase is sending him a bank transfer for a billion dollars."
2025-07-04 17:20:53,If he sold. He knows something is coming
2025-07-04 17:25:17,Too bad I was 11 when he bought in 🤣
2025-07-04 17:26:45,I wonder what he did time for?
2025-07-04 17:31:45,Sure he did
2025-07-04 17:31:54,....either that or he was hacked.
2025-07-04 17:42:52,Get ready for pdai.
2025-07-04 17:44:39,He finally remembered his password 🤑🤤
2025-07-04 17:46:35,I really hope this was a normie that waited
2025-07-04 17:47:11,Probably because the wealth will become a curse
2025-07-04 17:47:46,Daym... Talk about conviction
2025-07-04 17:49:50,Damn and I thought I was hot shit for selling 150 back in December.
2025-07-04 17:52:54,After a very pessimistic tax estimate he could spend 1 mil every month for the next 67 years
2025-07-04 17:54:59,Reddit tho : HoDl HOdl Hodl!!!!!!!! MAD FACE
2025-07-04 17:55:05,Gonna go ahead and say the obvious; he forgot he had bought them in 2011 and remembered today.
2025-07-04 17:56:59,Woke up and decided they wanted to be rich today.
2025-07-04 17:57:43,dude has found his wallet on the scrapyard
2025-07-04 18:00:09,Probably a presidential bribe.
2025-07-04 18:00:39,So insane to move it all in one transaction.
2025-07-04 18:07:12,I really hope bro invests some of that into a good security system lol grats on the billy
2025-07-04 18:09:28,"I can't believe someone made a single transfer of 10K bitcoin without even breaking it up or doing a test transfer, just one hail Mary!"
2025-07-04 18:10:00,A mind blowing amount of money
2025-07-04 18:16:53,This is indeed one of the posts of all time.
2025-07-04 18:17:26,"Middle finger to little Mikey...""*Here, HODL this*.""..."
2025-07-04 18:19:07,Found the time traveler.
2025-07-04 18:26:14,Dude calling his gf: im broke af.  1min later: I’m a billionaire!
2025-07-04 18:28:34,"He should consider adopting me, I cook, I’m funny and have other qualities 😂😂😂😂"
2025-07-04 18:34:17,"Serious question - what sort of institution/buyer would actually transfer >$1B for a single transaction?    Like - I know there are comments about ""wtf no test transfers first?"" but who would be on the other end of something like this?"
2025-07-04 18:42:13,Income gains tax boutta go BRRRRR
2025-07-04 18:52:41,"Whoever this was or is, definitely knew how to play the long game. Thats a total of $861,910,080.00 profit minus the transaction fee, cost to obtain the 10,000 coin, and 20% capital gains tax. 10,000 x $107,738.76 = $1,077,387,600  Or whatever the value was at the time of liquidating, but you get the idea."
2025-07-04 18:56:18,My question is who has 1B to buy Bitcoin? Like how the fuck fo you even find a buyer for that much?
2025-07-04 18:59:36,RemindMe! 14 years
2025-07-04 19:01:50,The secret to getting rich is just time!!
2025-07-04 19:09:34,Is there an exchange that could even pay that out?
2025-07-04 19:10:44,You don't need patience when you're up 100 million
2025-07-04 19:15:50,Maybe this person was in prison and just got a pardon?  Cough cough Dread Pirate Roberts?
2025-07-04 19:15:59,What would be the gas fees on a transaction like that?
2025-07-04 19:20:16,Who's buying?
2025-07-04 19:23:19,Imagine the capital gains tax
2025-07-04 19:31:24,Jesus Christ. Wow
2025-07-04 19:43:40,"Imagine the taxes, I think I'd cry."
2025-07-04 19:47:28,Honestly?  I forgot I had it
2025-07-04 19:51:25,Defer tax payments and live as a billionaire on the run. Not financial advice.
2025-07-04 20:06:53,He just waited till he was a billionaire. lol
2025-07-04 20:21:06,How do you view these transactions?
2025-07-04 20:25:56,How does such a payout work?
2025-07-04 20:26:20,\>never bought Bitcoin when it was sub .25c a dollar and had thousands 'cause I was in a rush putting out financial fires years ago.  Fuck me AND my priorities.
2025-07-04 20:31:31,Just one BTC would change my wife’s life forever.
2025-07-04 20:39:30,What if the guy lost his wallet and just found it again
2025-07-04 20:56:24,"Where does the money transfer to? His bank account? I’m New to this, so be easy."
2025-07-04 21:11:08,The only way to make true money is through time and patience. Investing and waiting for it to mature so you can reap the benefits takes a long time.
2025-07-04 21:19:43,Tax bill gotta hurt still
2025-07-04 21:30:18,Time traveler?
2025-07-04 21:32:19,paper hands
2025-07-04 21:37:11,Legend.
2025-07-04 21:41:36,"Since he sold it's not ""unmatched"" is it? There are people still holding who bought then."
2025-07-04 21:53:04,Maybe he was in jail jk
2025-07-04 21:57:42,How is this real money?
2025-07-04 21:58:14,Finally found that flash drive.
2025-07-04 22:06:30,"Wonder if this is the guy from Newport (UK), who threw out his old computer and has been trying to get permission to excavate the landfill. Pretty sure that was 10k BTC…  https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj3eg3n11gvo"
2025-07-04 22:08:00,I wonder what kind of wallet he stored it on 14 years ago and kept it there. How secure was that?
2025-07-04 22:12:37,What Exchange is that ? And can he just cash out 1B USD through an exchange? I thought they have cash out limits
2025-07-04 22:15:28,Is this the garbage dump worker who found the jump drive?
2025-07-04 22:17:35,I’m sure everybody fantasizes about what life would be like if they would’ve bought 10K bitcoin back in 2011. Crazy to see someone who did it and held onto to it this long.
2025-07-04 22:20:43,Wow!  Congratulations and God bless that person!
2025-07-04 22:21:19,Diamond hands personified!!
2025-07-04 22:23:18,Whales know that is alt season now
2025-07-04 22:26:22,How much money is that
2025-07-04 22:33:07,Champ
2025-07-04 22:34:11,From zero to 1bil. Thats nuts 👀
2025-07-04 22:41:12,There are more old wallets that got activated just now. Most likely there's something else going on here.
2025-07-04 22:42:32,What's the best way to facilitate this kind of sell? I'd too nervous to just sell in an exchange and see 1B sent to my bank. For sure the bank would say it's a mistake. How you do this the right way?
2025-07-04 22:46:43,Probably something else Shaq bet on ...
2025-07-04 22:56:06,someone found their wallet lol. There’s no way in hell any reasonable person even if this was half the price is currently at would hold for 14 years. This individual 100% found a lost wallet.
2025-07-04 23:06:35,Who buys $7800 in BTC in 2011?
2025-07-04 23:23:50,You know what I bought in 2009 with my $1000 I got from my high school graduation party? A fucking pre-built piece of shit PC from best buy. Where is the fucking restart button.
2025-07-04 23:25:44,Holy shit.
2025-07-04 23:30:16,What a legend
2025-07-04 23:35:33,How much lost to tax?
2025-07-04 23:42:59,"I sold 13 BTC in 2015 on account of my divorce, now I wish I would have been a little less honest with the court about my assets... For f*@ks sake I had to explain to the mediator what it was and how it worked. I should have told them I was all in on my RonPaulCoin and AnonCoin while conveniently forgetting to tell them about Bitcoin. 😂. I doubt either of them still exist as a functioning blockchain and my poor bitcoins that I had mined mostly with my own GPU rig from 2012 to 2014 when I was spending more on electricity than I was making in return, despite joining a pool... Certainly it would have been easy to hide back then, especally since I had mined most of it or made profit from a certain defunct bazaar on the Internet. Could have, should have, would have! Now I am stacking Sats instead of coins. 😆 I also regret my $100,000 hard drive every time I see it, was from Overstock.com and cost me 1 BTC in 2015. 🥹 On a positive note, I've gone through many old Bitcoin.dat and old Bip39 seed phrases and have actually found hundreds of dollars in ""dust"" that was too small to worry about back in the day... I was really early and f@$ked up because of real life interference but I still feel that we are technically early nevertheless because when people look back in 50 or 100 years this is still almost the beginning of a complete change in how we utilize and transfer value..."
2025-07-04 23:49:33,Just got out of prison
2025-07-04 23:53:57,He sold to Saylor I bet . Fuck that’s a lot of money !!!!
2025-07-04 23:56:46,He must have been in jail all this time no no thing someone would have held over 2020
2025-07-04 23:59:27,"We finally have a example that counters the usual argument of: ""Oh you woulda never held that long.""    This dude did."
2025-07-05 00:11:51,Jesus fuck
2025-07-05 00:29:32,"He later sold 30,000 more & total amounts to 4.4 billion dollars."
2025-07-05 00:48:27,"'Patience', sure whatever dude. More like 'incredibly lucky' since most crypto is a scam anyway."
2025-07-05 01:12:09,"My best guess is that he/she bought the bitcoin in 201 on a whim, totally forgot about it until recently, and then promptly hired a very highly paid financial advisor to time the eventual sale"
2025-07-05 01:13:15,Holy shit waited right for the 1 billion mark.
2025-07-05 01:19:04,"Could you imagine explaining this to your bank?  ""Ok, I'm literally expecting a billion dollars to show up in my account. Don't freak out."""
2025-07-05 01:29:23,I mean holy wow fucking Shit
2025-07-05 01:44:00,7.8k to a billion sheesh congratulations!
2025-07-05 01:44:39,"I knew of bitcoin in 2012, I just thought it was for buying drugs. I spent it all. Fuck man, if I even put in a couple grand back then... Hindsight is 20/20."
2025-07-05 01:53:06,Ok. Now what. I bought in 2017 at 6 or 7 something.   A real holder never forgets about inception of this magnificent opportunity.  EVER.   IT’S STILL QUITE WORTHY AND AVAILABLE! DIP YOU’RE BEAK
2025-07-05 02:06:53,What’s his payout after taxes ?
2025-07-05 02:16:02,Wow! Incredible  The dude got real independence.
2025-07-05 02:20:15,Does he have to pay taxes on the $2B?
2025-07-05 02:26:02,What’s 10k btc worth today ?
2025-07-05 03:00:34,I doubt it’s a person that controlled the account. no one would wait that long to cash out at least some of it. most likely it’s a government account (probably Chinese) that’s cashing out now. orders from higher up felt the time was to use the money on something else.
2025-07-05 03:06:45,I feel like the government just has these USB drives with a bunch of bitcoin & they give em out when they have favors done. & were eating it up
2025-07-05 03:07:07,That's a decent rate of return.
2025-07-05 03:28:11,Man I wish I had just bought it when it was some fractions of a cent...
2025-07-05 03:30:53,That's how billionaires are made. Certainly not the vast majority of us here.
2025-07-05 03:47:57,"There's no way he did that in one transaction right? Can you imagine the slippage selling that much at a time? This is probably the reason it never broke out to higher highs, that crazy bastard had a 10 000BTC limit order waiting at $110 600 on Coinbase lol."
2025-07-05 03:54:16,I still have the email from 2009 of someone trying to give me 10k bitcoin for two raid geared WoW accounts. Told him to basically kick rocks with that worthless shit.   Oh what a fool a was.
2025-07-05 04:00:52,This guy is the real hero of btc
2025-07-05 04:25:53,He just forgot he had it and just remembered the password.
2025-07-05 04:26:48,Is it the Green Shirt Guy?
2025-07-05 04:27:18,Lol y'all think they had diamond hands when in reality they probably lost the password YEARS ago and just found it while cleaning out their desk or some shit 🤣🤣
2025-07-05 04:59:40,Sounds like a lost wallet got hacked.
2025-07-05 05:07:58,I’ve got mine I mined with my processor on some site where people formed groups to mine blocks. Something pool.com. And some I bought later for $8 but sadly I spent 99.99% of them on drugs. What I have are essentially my couch cushions coins. And they’re 97% of my life savings. I still have the original wallet app with my history. I cried the last time I opened it up so I don’t anymore. That and it wants to download the entire block chain.
2025-07-05 05:20:49,"When you dont need the money, it's not a matter of patience. I've left assests forever simply because I just didn't need the money. I had other things going."
2025-07-05 05:41:41,I could build a fucking empire with that
2025-07-05 06:01:54,Congrats to him or her. .I'm happy for whom ever it is they definitely deserves this one
2025-07-05 06:10:01,"Can someone explain how this person can sell this amount of bitcoins, and the taxes afterwards."
2025-07-05 06:40:20,He hasn't sold a satoshi. He transferred.
2025-07-05 07:32:00,Happy for him.
2025-07-05 07:49:29,Ross Ulbricht?
2025-07-05 08:07:32,Investing $7800 at that time is a statement.
2025-07-05 09:33:53,Could have been a coma
2025-07-05 09:57:25,This is a text book example of how “Buy Low Sell High” is supposed to work.
2025-07-05 11:11:57,Been looking for his keys for 14 years.
2025-07-05 11:17:48,They probably just created them yesterday and flubbed the prior dates to make things pump. 
2025-07-05 11:21:05,"Absolute legend that level of diamond hands is rare. Makes you think what today’s undervalued projects will look like in a decade. I’m personally eyeing WHITENET real world assets on chain, licensed and still early. Could be one of those long term plays"
2025-07-05 12:17:33,"For someone like this, which platform is recommended to use that allows people to transfer funds to their bank accounts without limitations? Because those major platforms such as crypto.com and Coinbase has daily/monthly withdraw limits, a transaction this massive will surely get your account flagged or something by them when it happened. That’s why I’m curious"
2025-07-05 12:35:08,"My god, the capital gains tax on that!"
2025-07-05 13:07:03,I first saw bitcoin at around 32c but I was overseas and couldn’t buy. 🤦‍♂️
2025-07-05 13:24:50,He didn't sell it....
2025-07-05 13:35:36,"Just curious, what would be the tax on this?"
2025-07-05 14:13:23,Nah.. They cracked someone's wallet.
2025-07-05 14:41:39,I have a feeling.  An ex Microsoft and was one of the first 1000 employees. He is and was then an early angel investor.   I dated a guy that spent $100 at the .78.   In 2017. I bought. I owe him a huge thanks.
2025-07-05 15:45:07,Wow. Someone isn't going to work on Monday.
2025-07-05 16:00:29,He probably forgot about it until the other day lmao
2025-07-05 16:40:50,"How do you even sell 10,000 BTC? 🤔"
2025-07-05 17:16:44,"Good for him 😊 may we all know close to this kind of patience, kindness, and dumb luck. Dude definitely didn’t have to accept the BTC for the pizza"
2025-07-05 18:15:01,What website is this where you can view the transactions?!
2025-07-05 18:42:17,"Other than the patience, I would have to say this was the least amount of effort anyone has put forth to become (almost) a billionaire aside from inheritance."
2025-07-05 18:48:29,"plot twist: the guy was in jail, the BTC was from illicit stuff, and he's only moving it because he got an on-chain message with a legal threat.  the world is not that beauty you guys try to paint."
2025-07-05 19:27:51,"I bet this was the guy who bought my 4 used raspberry pis from me 15 years ago who said he was using them for a top secret thing it was the biggest idea in centuries and he was going to mine a cryptocurrency with all of these devices connected and tons more he was looking to buy.   Gosh. I wish I would have asked him if I could get in on it with him!! I should try to track him down, tell him to share since I gave him my hardware 🤣"
2025-07-05 20:12:41,Waited for that 1b
2025-07-05 21:00:01,Silk Road. I can’t be the only one to think this
2025-07-05 22:18:04,"He sold his BTC for actual cash? Sorry for a stupid question but how does that work, if that's the case??"
2025-07-05 23:43:15,Is it possible to know the IP address/country where these ancient BTCs were mined/generated?
2025-07-06 00:53:56,"Who said he sold? These coins were transferred, no mention wether he just changed wallet or sold."
2025-07-06 00:57:25,There are going to be a huge number of career bag holders when this scam implodes.
2025-07-06 01:19:56,It was moved not sold
2025-07-06 01:54:35,It's Satoshi. vertisan.org Stop being close-minded and PTSD.  The future is now.
2025-07-06 05:36:11,The best $7800 he's ever spent.
2025-07-06 06:04:10,"If anyone could call the top, it's got to be this guy."
2025-07-06 09:00:01,That‘s all it takes. He changed the life of generations to come…
2025-07-06 12:18:29,"Yeah, I would sell at a billion as well"
2025-07-06 12:48:55,Don't get enamoured by BitCoin after 2026. It's value only lies in scarcity and trading. Get into stable coins.
2025-07-06 14:10:26,You’re an idiot if you think he actually waited he probably didn’t have access to them
2025-07-06 17:48:33,"But why sell now?  Seems idiotic After all this time, yes the returns are epic, but the real bull run tends to happen right now from 12-18 months after the halving, so the real increase should happen between now and December -ish  It will at least double if not 5x or even 10x by the time the bull run is over"
2025-07-07 02:19:43,But where did it go TO...?
2025-07-07 06:30:57,What exchange did he cash out on
2025-07-07 06:52:04,"Unmatched? I think Satoshi would have something to say about that, or anyone else sitting on gains from that era."
2025-07-07 08:21:13,Someone is rich!
2025-07-08 00:22:29,Wow
2025-07-08 01:13:39,And how much did you make?
2025-07-08 01:28:19,It’s easy to be patient when youre sitting in a prison cell with no access to your wallet
2025-07-08 02:28:19,He the bitcoin co creator
2025-07-08 03:07:20,Time traveler

2025-07-08 05:25:36,Back
2025-07-08 06:59:42,Probably not a person. Probably an intelligent agency or something!
2025-07-08 09:20:07,So wait he bought x amount of btc at $0.78 and it reached 10k after x amount of years later so he cashed out at 10k that’s how it works right you buy one btc and leave it for 5 years and if right you will 10x your investment?
2025-07-08 10:51:57,"Who the hell buys 10,000 BTC in 2011!? What did they know!"
2025-07-08 13:45:14,Dudes probably just got out of prison.

2025-07-09 12:39:30,did he really sell? you'd think we see that in the chart?

2025-07-04 12:25:00,"So, somebody just paid $1B for bunch of coins? In one deal? Who is this guy?!"
2025-07-04 20:23:06,"Bitcoin mints a new Billionaire everyday.   No, but for real, I don't think we actually understand how many longtime OG's are selling supply at $100k which is what's suppressing the price.   I think once all of them rotate out we're good to go. It's kind of like how many people will be selling at $1M from todays era. "

2025-07-04 10:29:29,Lets be real here.... homeboy FORGOT he even had it 😅 and probably remembered in the last 2yrs and just rode it. Most people would fold at least half after it hit a G.   Hope he has a few shell companies to hide a lot of it 🤔... assuming 1 bill in any country is gonna get some serious attention

2025-07-04 16:50:28,Probably is Roger Ver.
2025-07-04 17:28:38,Waited until that estate law got signed by the pres before moving the money
2025-07-04 17:45:56,You really need to lock your portfolio for moves like that.

2025-07-04 21:55:31,"he only had one? yea 10k is nothing these days unfortunatly, cant even buy a car with it. I guess you can pay off any minor debts with that. Not the student ones tho hahaha"
2025-07-05 02:31:46,It's Elon
2025-07-04 08:22:35,But then shouldn’t the price have dropped drastically? It looks like it didn’t change much?
2025-07-04 10:34:22,Fake money sold for real money. Anyone want to buy  1 minecraft brick for 1B? People are really stupid.
2025-07-04 08:37:45,"Underrated, now he's buying the whole franchise."
2025-07-04 10:20:19,You could be correct.  There was a post a month ago on another sub-reddit about the 14 year anniversary of the 10k bitcoin pizza purchase.
2025-07-04 10:01:59,Dude gonna buy whole McDonald this time
2025-07-04 11:53:00,Ive met that guy at a golf course. He is super cool and just plays golf all the time now while living in Miami. Its funny because he still doesn’t want people to know his name and tries to hide it as much as possible.
2025-07-04 14:38:50,No that guy went on a cross country road trip and spent it all
2025-07-05 01:37:52,I accepted Bitcoin on my bike taxi 7 years ago. I only got a handful. Don't regret it.
2025-07-04 11:38:59,He owns a pizza company now I guess
2025-07-04 12:26:32,I worked with the seller
2025-07-04 12:31:41,"Man, it must be some great pizza for him to trade it back now"
2025-07-04 12:46:53,That’s an expensive pizza
2025-07-04 13:06:17,"that pizza indeed the best investment he ever did, I wish we all have the same or better opportunity like that sooner or later"
2025-07-04 13:13:11,I bought one for 8.9 bitcoins back in the day...
2025-07-04 13:18:32,It was not the pizza guy. The pizza guy received normal dollars. Someone else got the BTC and paid the pizza in dollars.
2025-07-04 13:37:23,That guy that sold it still lives in Jacksonville and the Papa Johns on Beach Blvd has a plaque of that BTC transaction.
2025-07-04 13:51:05,Pizza papa always gets paid.
2025-07-04 15:04:31,What I have read is that he sold these 10k btc for videogames short time later
2025-07-04 22:28:41,"That would have been awesome for him. He actually spent it pretty quickly on travel and video games according to [interviews he did later](https://www.bitcoinwhoswho.com/jercosinterview?):  ""Q. What do you primarily use bitcoins for? Do you still control millions of dollars worth?  A. Bitcoin as a currency is meant to be spent. Those 10,000 BTC made it back into the economy fairly quickly, around the time they were worth some $400. A ~10x ROI from simply trading in a different currency is quite good, even if that factor could have been higher had I held on to said currency longer. Naturally there will always be people hoarding coins, trying to get rich, and quite a few people did get quite rich, but they wouldn't have got that way without economic growth allowing it. To that extent my bitcoin holdings do usually measure in hundreds or thousands of USD, simply because I use them much as I would a checking account, to conduct business both online and offline when I have the opportunity. Notably the ""humble bundles"" and the attached store accepting bitcoins significantly bolstered my video game library."""
2025-07-05 09:33:35,True
2025-07-05 16:11:42,No way
2025-07-04 12:10:55,Likely a forced hodl
2025-07-04 17:24:11,"This guy has to already be rich, no way someone could resist selling at even at 100 million."
2025-07-04 16:53:11,"But he sold, so not diamond hands?"
2025-07-04 08:12:22,This is the craziest thing about the whole story 😂
2025-07-04 08:17:26,What if this IS the test transaction
2025-07-04 08:10:48,Thats fucking crazy I would sweat my life on the « send » button
2025-07-04 09:14:04,Instant Billionaire... I can't imagine the feeling about 14years of endurance..
2025-07-04 08:21:49,Yet i triple check before sending out $40
2025-07-04 08:09:57,Imagine amount of times he checked the address 😂
2025-07-04 08:41:37,biggest balls in the universe
2025-07-04 09:18:16,I sent 1k before and pissed my pants waiting for it to show up.
2025-07-04 08:15:08,Hope it accidentally went to my wallet

2025-07-04 12:16:04,"time traveller.  I had 900 back when they were 1$ they were given to me, and I gave them away because it was like silly game currency, it was a meme thing who cared.  to invest 10k before that, and sit and hold for 14 years and sell. you'd have to be a time traveller to have such a vision.  its like predicting the lottery numbers 15 years in advance, and putting a 10k bet down that you will win."
2025-07-04 11:51:45,I sent a test $1 when I’m moving $100 to my family wtf bro
2025-07-04 13:11:13,"Test transaction can result in losing the remaining amount, depending on how you do it. So he did it properly :-D"

2025-07-04 08:14:21,Wonder if Chad has more stored away.
2025-07-04 09:53:15,Have we also assumed that he didn't mess up the address on the withdraw?
2025-07-04 09:57:21,Good Lord....
2025-07-04 09:58:24,I always wonder if they just lost and recover their keys or they're just released from a prisond
2025-07-04 09:59:47,Holy shit. Why.
2025-07-04 10:20:44,"If I was Satoshi, I would have lots of hidden wallets, with 1k or 10k BTC, many with a value not likely to cause panic. Never sell off the main wallet, since that would cause shock waves, but instead sell from the smaller wallets.  In that situation no need for a test transaction, since I would have hundreds of wallets to test first.  Of course, I am not Satoshi, but you get the idea. This guy is likely selling off one of his spare wallets."
2025-07-04 10:34:10,It’s a QR code scan P2P selling to Blackrock.  No test transaction was needed.
2025-07-04 10:34:29,When you realized this was the test transaction...
2025-07-04 10:36:40,No human would do that without a test transaction.  It has to be a computer Ai or something
2025-07-04 10:45:55,He wanted to save on fees.😅🤣
2025-07-04 10:57:48,God. Balls of steel.
2025-07-04 11:08:26,It’s possible they were sweeping an old paper wallet stored as just the private key. That’s best done in a single transaction.
2025-07-04 11:18:46,it was probably a paper wallet so it had to be done all at once there's no other way.
2025-07-04 11:24:35,He was already a billionaire. Could be one of the companies that secretly control bitcoin.
2025-07-04 11:32:32,Maybe he was testing for 1$ and sent the full 1B$
2025-07-04 11:37:51,What if it's Satoshi? The only one I'd imagine with that kind of trust.
2025-07-04 11:44:02,He has platinum balls :)))
2025-07-04 11:52:35,Plot twist. This was the test transaction
2025-07-04 12:03:28,That is very scary
2025-07-04 12:05:32,"how do you know he succeeded? now he moved to the wrong wallet effectively ""burning"" the supply xD"
2025-07-04 12:06:03,"Its blackjack theory, your best bet is your first bet."
2025-07-04 12:07:10,"ill let you know a little ""hack"" you press ctrl+c then ctrl+v it copies the address perfectly!"
2025-07-04 12:07:32,That's where it came from ...   My wallet exploded ..
2025-07-04 12:11:18,“he is very fluent”
2025-07-04 12:15:29,How common are test transactions? I would assume it would be safer doing multiple transactions of smaller units like 0.25 bitcoin than risking sending multiple bitcoin and risk a mistake that costs you everything.
2025-07-04 12:22:03,I get nervous sending a hundred bucks. Checking every letter of the address even though I copy/pasted it 🤦‍♂️
2025-07-04 12:36:10,He must have had other accounts tooo.. No way I would trust that
2025-07-04 12:47:45,"Ross Ulbricht maybe?  Been in prison for the past 12 years. sure there's the 50,000 bitcoin from silk road that the fed knew about and got its hands on, but what if he had a bit of something else stashed away ?"
2025-07-04 12:57:33,"Actually, if it was paper wallet, leaving anything there is quite risky once exposing the keys to the wallet software you used."
2025-07-04 13:31:07,My man got huge balls.
2025-07-04 13:41:38,I wonder who bought it for that chunk.
2025-07-04 13:42:24,His test transaction would be more than our entire stack 😭
2025-07-04 14:31:01,He likely has other Bitcoin and did tests to make sure it was go time
2025-07-04 14:53:41,Might be the kids who inherited it
2025-07-04 14:55:43,"seriously, even banks probably wouldn’t do a 1 billion wire transfer without a prenote or small denom wire transfer and make the receiver confirm first lol"
2025-07-04 15:47:27,"I'm not into BTC but just curious the people who are, the fact that you feel you need test transactions doesn't set off red flags?"
2025-07-04 16:10:01,Why does the future of finance require a test transaction?
2025-07-04 17:18:12,"He’s got fuck you money now, though. Goddamn."
2025-07-04 18:10:03,That's exactly what I just commented lol. I do a test send for 1K lol
2025-07-04 19:39:23,It's the guy that went to the landfill to find his missing hard drive. He found it and now claims he's giving up looking for it so people don't question his fortune.
2025-07-04 19:51:53,"If you need a test transaction, you are doing something wrong, or the person you are sending to is incompetent."
2025-07-04 20:25:56,Well he’s had 14 years to get it right. Wouldn’t be too much of a stretch that he sold it off to a cold wallet to avoid paying for tax season.
2025-07-04 22:42:32,This was not the owner of the wallet most likely who transferred.
2025-07-04 23:14:02,He finally remembered his password
2025-07-05 01:01:05,The 10K was the test transaction for his much larger wallet
2025-07-05 02:30:27,Here I am doing a test transfer to move like $200 🤣
2025-07-05 02:58:23,Fucking time travelers.

2025-07-04 09:13:34,Could also be just a hack
2025-07-04 08:21:04,Insane that his cost is reading $0 😂 they rounded down lmao
2025-07-04 09:24:45,And no test transaction  ![gif](giphy|AxpvyWYDHuIH6)

2025-07-04 10:46:45,I'm guessing AI found a novel method to get the private key from the public in a much shorter period of time. Because once it was found out that was  possible Bitcoin would be worthless.  So go for the biggest amount that has been sitting around for so long and the original owner lost access to.

2025-07-04 10:17:27,If he is and he cashed out now does that mean a crash is coming?
2025-07-04 10:20:53,Which would probably mean it's time for everyone to sell.

2025-07-04 11:17:11,If you bought anything with bitcoin then you are responsible for the price it's at today. If everyone had the mind set of hold until its worth a ton then it never would of gotten to this price to begin with. So don't beat yourself up over it. I bought a shit ton of drugs and I still don't really regret it since I was buying when it was worth $10 or less

2025-07-04 15:44:39,"The earliest wallets are the safest wallets. Many of them were stored offline, private keys weren't held by 3rd parties, they used simple, direct key storage without complicated infrastructure, and they predate most modern attack vectors."
2025-07-04 19:54:38,"I don't think that this transaction is due to a hacked wallet.  At least not with the information we have so far.  However, there is a real chance that a massive cracking effort has unlocked a few wallets by now.   Why do I believe it?  There's state actors such as N. Korea, Israel, and America and there may be others that have motivation and perhaps the capabilities.   Motivation: Moving billions of dollars in an economy worth a few trillion could easily influence prices and allow market manipulation.    Just showing someone that you control this amount of money could let you borrow against it and get ready access to money and resources that doesn't have to go through, say Congress for example.     Perhaps you can prove to an arms dealer that you are good for the money, put half in one wallet and half in another.  Give them the keys to one wallet and hold the other keys for the other until they deliver your black market warhead, custom e. coli strain, gently used B2 bomber, etc.  Capabilities: That's the thing.  Noone can say with any authority how much computing power any one nation can bring to bear on a problem like this.   Nor can we say what backdoors and workarounds they may have discovered.  All we can actually say is that there are people playing in this sandbox.  We don't know who's a toddler eating catshit and who's the high schooler building award winning sand sculpture.  The Bybit hack is the biggest example the public is aware of yet.   This was a sophisticated attack taking advantage in a vulnerability in the process of a transfer, redirecting the funds to the attacker's wallet.  Details are still coming out on this and money laundering is absolutely still in progress.  Beyond phishing and social engineering attacks, there are a few other theoretical methods publicly known.  That said, these are mostly academic in nature and the only ""effective"" method I have seen cannot be directly targetted.      The thing is, big organizations with secrets to keep could absolutely have capabilities beyond what we may be aware of.  Whose to say the surveillance backdoors in all of our phones aren't collecting your passphrase?  Would it be a stretch to say that there are bigger botnets than we've ever seen quietly working on the problem?  Could a nation have secret supercomputing capacity beyond what it publicly acknowledges?  Who knows?"

2025-07-04 10:23:34,"Bitcoin wasn't really seen as an investment asset then, it was seen as a disrupter to currency. It was all discussed on BTC forums not reddit."
2025-07-04 12:11:29,"That was me, though not on Reddit. Never imagined Bitcoin would be worth a dollar. Kept thinking it would collapse after every milestone."
2025-07-04 10:32:06,"$11k (inflation adjusted) in investments is definitely not the bar for ""rich"". Millions of people in America alone have $50k+ in savings right now."

2025-07-04 11:28:19,Lmao? How poor are you
2025-07-04 13:26:58,He probably was going to use that money to originally buy things on Silk Road like drugs but changed plans.
2025-07-05 06:47:01,"I found an old ira I forgot about from 2012 last month. I'm well off but not rich, and I had completely forgotten about the $3k in it until they sent me a letter at my new new new new new address. It had grown to $8k over the years. I knew about bitcoin at that time but poo pooed, so I'm not saying it could have been me, but I did completely forget about a chunk of change that if it were bitcoin would have been a  hundred million. Its totally possible that the owner of that wallet booted up an old computer and had a 'holy shit' moment."
2025-07-04 08:55:30,"Na. You’d need to let them know ahead of time, and would be dealing with ppl that handle special accounts. Billionaires don’t walk in the lobby lol"

2025-07-04 23:20:31,"Can you image how many people hold some BTC without their spouse knowing?   It probably doesn’t start that way. It was a casual purchase that turned into a short term obsession. Then you stop.   Then as time passed, you just never said anything because you know it’s just easier to STFU and maybe be a hero later.   If you say it, even if it is not much today, if it does become something, you don’t want someone encouraging you to sell.   You don’t have to sell to access the equity in your holdings. It’s easier to hold if you can spend 4% on a loan for a few years. If you make it 4 more then you don’t need to worry about the loan from 4 years ago. Especially if you added collateral to match your spending.    Don’t get liquidated. That is the game."
2025-07-04 12:11:54,"Before reading your comment, I was leaning towards another commenter who said time travel.  Thanks for some sane possibilities."
2025-07-04 16:09:49,"There are now 14 of those wallets, moving around (not selling) total of $8.69B worth of BTC… that might be the reason why there were no test transfers. Because there were another 13 wallets preparing to move. One comment said “the first wallet transfer was the test” 💀"
2025-07-04 12:16:33,"Apparently it was 20k 10 in each wallet someone else said and posted a link, i didnt double check but it was 10k to each wallet. So 16k original buyin, still absurdly doable and realistically a moo amount of money when talking about retirement\\investments etc.   I mean 16k 14 years ago was 20 percent down on a 165k house, not exactly world changing amounts but at the same time as you said not an insignificant fund and at the same time why only 16k? If 16 wasnt that important that you could leave it for when BTC hit all its milestones over the years without deciding to cash out you probably had enough that the 16k wasnt a huge deal.   But maybe it wasnt a huge deal and someone with a bit of money said fuck it lets see what this does in a decade or two.   Id have cashed in way, way way before no matter the circumstances im sure"
2025-07-04 22:37:56,How does one program a dead man’s switch into bitcoin which has no smart contracts? Especially that long ago. Don’t think that option is possible.
2025-07-04 15:42:59,Agreed.

2025-07-04 16:38:50,"Haha I attended a tech expo thing back in 2011 and there was a talk about Bitcoin.. to demonstrate how it worked and kinda give some hype everyone there got a btc. At the time I definitely thought ""spiffy, don't really care that much though"" and promptly forgot about it.

2025-07-04 19:41:48,"Quantum computing doesn't really help you hack anything. If you had a quantum computer as powerful as a normal computer (we're only like a thousand orders of magnitude away from that lol), it effectively halves the encryption strength, i.e. SHA512 becomes SHA256.  Assume a brute-force algorithm that iterates over all the possible 256-bit lines (that won’t actually guarantee the success, but most of the time that will be enough). So we need to process 2 ^ 256 variants of 256-bit string, which is roughly 3.2 * 10^79 bits. Assume we’ve got a full access to the best machine (according to TOP500 List - June 2019) - IBM Summit. It has about 2.5 millions of IBM POWER9 cpus and (according to User’s Manual) every such unit can hash 3.7 Gb of data every second, which means the whole cluster at best can process about 3.7 * 10 ^ 9 * 2.5 * 10 ^ 6 = 9.25 * 10 ^ 15 bits of data every second. So we need at least 3.5 * 10 ^ 63 seconds = 1.1 * 10 ^ 57 years. Which is much more then the Earth exists. And here I haven’t touched problems of memory bandwidth, storage etc."
2025-07-04 13:58:04,"It's a p2pkh address. If I understand correctly, in order for it to be a quantum hack, it'd have to be a p2pk address. Since the public key is hashed it's not vulnerable to Shor's algorithm, and I think the advantage from Grover's algorithm is not enough."
2025-07-04 14:11:45,Where’s your evidence of this?
2025-07-04 17:59:55,Nobody. It was a coin transfer not a sale.

The dude probably has to go intensive KYC and a LOT of questions to get this amount of money in his banks. But if he's legit, it's easy.  Dude probably withdraws like 50M to his bank and let's the rest roll. Not point in cashing out the ENTIRE stash"
2025-07-04 13:24:21,Yup
2025-07-04 11:44:07,Cashing out their assets
2025-07-04 13:20:46,Makes me wonder what AI could do to mathematically judge and figure out what the stock market could do with investments.
2025-07-04 13:19:10,Imagine if you still had it lol
2025-07-04 12:50:58,Where do I sign up?
2025-07-04 14:00:28,No different than any other stock really. It’s all “virtual” until someone buys in with cash. Which let’s face it is also virtual.
2025-07-04 13:59:26,"There’s 19.8M BTC and >300,000 BTC traded a day. Moving 10K will not take years."
2025-07-04 14:40:41,Very. That address is well known.
2025-07-04 14:18:26,"You’re assuming the transaction is by an American (with world-wide taxation, normal countries don’t bother)  Most people cashing in $1bn would break their tax normal tax residencies and complete the transaction resident in the UAE."
2025-07-04 14:34:45,at 1 billion dollars? you're right he could have waited for 10 billions lol
2025-07-04 18:07:18,Prison release...

2025-07-04 18:06:23,"It was bought for $7800 and it wasn't sold, it was transferred, but the value is 1.1 billion today.  And it happened 8 times today."
2025-07-04 14:45:11,"And that $1B can sit untouched, safe and secure for 14 years"
2025-07-05 03:56:03,"They are getting hacked left and right, most popular crypto hacks are phishing type, usually done in Twitter or Facebook where a bot would impersonate famous people and pretend to hold an event where if people send them 1 Bitcoin they will receive 2 Bitcoin back."
2025-07-04 21:20:32,Block explorer is one
2025-07-04 22:15:18,So you would rather live in a shit country with 1 billion than in the USA with 800 million?
2025-07-04 21:17:06,If you could acquire bitcoin in 2011 you can handle moving between wallets
2025-07-04 17:57:02,"> he sold it  It was a transfer, not a sale. There were also 8 such transfers."
2025-07-04 19:00:01,Breaking it up probably acheives less than you think it does. His inputs are 53 tiny ones plus 10k. What would sending $10 achieve if you're trying to shift $1B?   https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/transactions/btc/9d5d67169a37222720b407c99939f7baa40587eef9ab16ec3a17c7c856ef9045
2025-07-04 18:57:10,"You're right, that's a lot for a single institution, and the receiving address isn't multisig, so I would tip it being a transfer between two wallets controlled by one individual."
2025-07-04 19:08:20,"$0.78 x 10,000 bitcoin costs $7,800.  There's also a few jurisdictions where it's pleasant to live where this would be tax free (I am not your tax advisor).   So let's just call it a billion profit, okay?"

2025-07-04 21:05:03,Ross’ coins got seized. Community is propping him up. He fucked up a million(s) dollar Tx when he first got out 😂
2025-07-04 21:03:38, No gas with Bitcoin. Just a miner fee.
2025-07-04 19:57:05,There are some nice islands where they don't care so much about taxes.
2025-07-04 20:28:22,It is a public ledger
2025-07-04 21:01:07,Look at the public ledger.   Block explorer etc etc  People out here playing and don’t know how to access the PUBLIC ledger 🤯
2025-07-04 21:11:35,The transaction shows where it goes if you pull it up.
2025-07-05 01:54:11,Do they have capitol gains tax on crypto?
2025-07-05 02:30:20,Not usually

2025-07-04 21:05:33,All his shit got seized
2025-07-04 22:27:06,Wtf are you talking about? That’s $1Billion
2025-07-04 09:25:41,A lot of people seem to assume that a transaction happening on the network means coins have been sold.

2025-07-04 17:28:12,Im sure their is way more to this story they don’t tell you!
2025-07-04 17:32:44,He could buy a couple with $1.1B.
2025-07-04 21:46:37,Mate more than that
2025-07-04 10:46:31,Nah because that would make it a $7.5k pizza?
2025-07-04 12:46:55,"I feel like I read something that he sold all or some of that BTC a few years later, but I could just be creating that memory"
2025-07-04 12:57:07,No. I remember watching something with the guy who traded the pizza for bitcoin. He said he sold them when they got to like $0.05 or something.
2025-07-04 15:56:39,"It says ""he bought them for .78 a piece"",  not ""received them for a pizza""."
2025-07-04 21:04:51,> You could be correct.  A single 5 sec google search would prove it wrong. Even your comment probably took more to type out.  The guy that sold the pizza later sold it for like 200 dollars.
2025-07-04 13:05:23,"Doesn't want people to know him or that he's that guy, but shares that info with random people at golf courses.   Sure, sounds believable."

2025-07-05 02:08:13,This sub is dumb. Early adopters believed in BTC like you don't.
2025-07-04 18:53:09,"They could have been borrowing against it, so instead of cashing in the bitcoin he could have paid a nominal amount of interest and let bitcoin multiply."

2025-07-04 13:50:05,and he hand typed the receiving address

2025-07-04 12:11:05,"Tbh, he must have been rich before or not? Surely the difference of 500 million vs 1 billion is not worth almost 5 years more you could have spent with that money.

2025-07-04 13:09:39,I know what you're saying but holding for 14 years isn't instant. They knew what their net worth was.
2025-07-04 13:47:42,Even when it hit $1000 that's $10 million right there. Then to see your fortune go to $200m by the end of 2017 and crash ~85% and still hold? Not many of us could have done that.

2025-07-04 09:30:47,And I thought I was fucking crazy. Only a woman could own this a man would never yolo a 1 billion dollar transfer without so much as a test first
2025-07-04 18:42:37,"Depends on what country he’s in. If it’s the UAE Singapore or if he’s owned it for more than 12 months in Germany (which he clearly had) 0% tax  If it’s Australia 50% with a 50% discount so 25%   Depends but if he does pay tax the tax man will be laughing   Then there’s the issue of having a crypto friendly bank aswell that’ll actually accept that sort of money coming in from crypto, a lot of them don’t want crypto sales money because on AML risks etc"

They’re cashing out before the 9th that’s when shit goes down, historically markets always crash hard after blowing through an ATH"

2025-07-04 14:35:11,Satoshi's name translates to Central Intelligence roughly. BTC used obscure NSA code. CIA Snowden was its biggest marketer. Etc.
2025-07-04 19:16:57,8 10k transfers now

2025-07-04 13:02:36,Or someone hacked the guy and moved the money.

2025-07-04 09:21:01,Nobody has use for $1 billion all at once
2025-07-04 12:50:05,Most likely a sophisticated investor even then.

2025-07-04 13:34:35,"this is most likely what happened. honestly, anyone that thinks that these huge bitcoin trades are made by average joe's that struck it big is just very naive."
2025-07-04 17:21:49,No such thing. This is an unprecedented liquidity event.
2025-07-04 18:16:00,"Yes, knew a guy who had a ton of bitcoin from the launch. 2015 it was going up and he said he was just going to let it sit for a few years since he didnt need the money."
2025-07-04 11:51:39,Ross Ulbricht got out of prison not long ago. He was arrested in 2013 and before that he would have had large amounts of crypto. Maybe?

2025-07-05 12:00:35,I stick can't believe bro got pardoned
2025-07-04 11:38:34,I'm assuming it's a payment for the pardon.
2025-07-04 12:03:18,I was thinking the same. I’ve bought coins 5 years ago. Good ones. And I’ve made fuck all.  I might look into this prison deal though.
2025-07-04 23:51:42,"That way of thinking is nonsense, really.  You could be a fiat currency trader and leverage the shit out of your trades and make just as much money a lot more quickly if you could see the future."
2025-07-17 09:18:43,"No, it was too far-fetched."

2025-07-04 11:50:33,"Holy shit, wait a minute"
2025-07-04 17:52:48,Didnt they seize most his coins?
2025-07-05 02:37:40,"That guy's coins were allegedly from mining so they'd be having lots of 50-coin inputs. These are not those coins, case closed."
2025-07-05 00:31:02,Your all assuming it’s the Silk Road dude no proof behind it
2025-07-05 02:12:33,Weird ash looking at my recent comments.. you literally have nothing better to do. How does this even relate to sports betting? Weird mf
2025-07-04 13:12:54,Crash is always coming.
2025-07-04 14:34:03,"Probably more like he hit a billion. That's just an outrageous amount of money, plus he can call himself a billionaire now rather than millionaires"

2025-07-08 08:05:52,He did not cash out
2025-07-04 10:53:48,That's how you start a panic
2025-07-05 04:56:11,January was not a few weeks ago...
2025-07-04 15:35:19,"I wasn't an investor, I was a miner.  I had 7000btc and sold them for $3 a piece. The price had been higher but it started crashing and I figured that was the end of the experiment and sold them and then the price kept going up and up and up.  I remember being sick to my stomach and then it hit 100 and all I could think was how why what. Part of me wanted to get back in, to buy but I figured if I did it would crash and that was all just some big bubble and it would crash to nothing so I never did.  300 ... then 500 then 1000 and still the only thing I could think was it had to be a bubble that would crash to nothing but it kept going and going"
2025-07-04 09:59:58,Could also be some engineer working on quantum computing..
2025-07-04 11:17:33,I would’ve still had some though obviously not most of it.  When I buy stuff that moons I sell some and profit take and let some ride.  Repeat as necessary
2025-07-04 12:24:31,"I bought 2 wallets of 250 btc each for $250. I used some to buy a dominos pizza because coincard was the only thing I knew you could do with it when I bought it. I traded the rest of that wallet for magic the gathering cards. The other wallet I sold for $250. I thought I made out great at the time. Years later I got really depressed, like suicidally depressed, when the price exploded and I still get sick to my stomach when I think about it."
2025-07-04 16:05:45,"This is what I tell myself to feel better. I almost bought $100 at <$1 just to play around and then never did and forgot. No way would I have held out for 100,000x, but might have hit $1M, which still sucks to think about. "
2025-07-04 09:17:42,Could also someone just has a computer program running fulltime to guess the phrases and get the BTC. Or some quantum computer researcher at google who has this side project and now is rich.
2025-07-04 09:31:56,Gonna guess he meant dihydrogen mate
2025-07-04 15:06:37,Hydrogen gas
2025-07-04 13:48:46,"Yeah i still don’t understand how this took off so much, first time I considered buying btc was because I wanted to buy drugs with it. I thought that was its only purpose.   I chickened out but was it was under $1.00 at the time, I just had no faith that it would work or that the post office wouldn’t catch it so I bought my drugs in person instead."
2025-07-04 11:43:31,"You'd think so, but BTC is almost a cult in how much people value it as the 'new gold'."
2025-07-04 21:01:44,beyond that- they are monitored by enough people that someone would know a shatoshi wallet became active.
2025-07-04 17:53:25,I wonder if its closely monitored and people have set up automations to just cash in as soon anything leaves that wallet.
2025-07-06 19:20:09,"Why?! Even if Satoshi had 3m BTC and for inexplicable reason dumped them all on the market (not even possible without OTC work), now you have a new supply of 3m from 21m ever. How is that significant in the long term? There is no supply shock coming, ever. There is only demand increase at some gradual rate."
2025-07-04 12:30:31,seems the most likely person
2025-07-04 15:10:16,it's not definitely anyone. all you have is an address.
2025-07-04 16:06:37,"I thoughtI heard a while back they were able to seize his assets, including the keys."
2025-07-04 11:43:45,"The fact that the expression ""investment asset"" is used _today_ to describe bitcoins still floors me."
2025-07-04 11:36:15,"Well, there were some subreddits. But they’ve been long-banned and their husks resurrected to become DEA/FBI honeypots. Things like the Silk Road sub or general DNM sub come to mind. "
2025-07-11 17:08:10,"Back then, I saw it like today's Labubu trend. It's just a short term bubble and sooner or later people are gonna forget about it. Turns out I was horribly wrong. Now I can't even afford 1 BTC"
2025-07-04 10:39:05,"Maybe where you come from, but even if I had $50k saved up I would not gamble away 20% of it. People really need to understand how poor the average person is. Bitcoin might be an investment now, but it started off hugely speculative as a form of investment. People who can gamble away 20% of their life savings are quite rich for my standards. And if you ask me, if you say millions in the US have that much saved up that puts them in the upper percentage of the global 8 billion population. By percentage they are considered rich…"
2025-07-04 10:52:41,"Sounds kind of high when 28% of Americans have less than $1,000 in savings.   * https://bankingjournal.aba.com/2024/08/survey-one-in-four-americans-have-less-than-1000-in-savings/  I mean, in a country with 330 million people, sure could be true, but that's definitely not a majority."
2025-07-04 10:40:52,Most of those investments are probably in something that has a higher chance of returning profits than bitcoin did in 2011. Someone who puts 10k into big established stocks is taking a lot less risk than someone buying a virtual currency that nobody has ever heard of. He definitely had money before this. 
2025-07-04 11:08:16,In 2011 bitcoin was about as high risk an investment as you could find. Nobody expected it to ever have any real value back then.
2025-07-04 15:58:34,"This is Reddit, most users savings are the loose change that fell under a sofa cushion five years ago."
2025-07-04 16:17:29,BTC wasn't considered an investment in 2011.
2025-07-04 18:25:32,"> $11k (inflation adjusted) in investments is definitely not the bar for ""rich"". Millions of people in America alone have $50k+ in savings right now.  I agree but risking $11k on what bitcoin was at the time would be like plopping down at a roulette table with $11k and going all in a few times in a row on black.    Even rich people don't just risk that kind of money all the time.   I say this as someone who bought in 2015.  I'd easily, and have, dropped 5x my initial investment into bitcoin recently without even batting an eye while back in 2015 I figured that money was good as gone most likely."
2025-07-05 04:12:04,11K USD in investments is not even fathomable for my ass.
2025-07-07 07:15:18,"11% of the American population has 50k or more in savings.  While that is technically “millions of people”,  it goes to show that your bar being much higher is your own opinion and not the standard.  89% of Americans would think you’re rich for spending 7800 on bitcoin 15 years ago."
2025-07-04 12:57:10,You must be playing around with the allowance from mommy if you think whacking 7.8k on a speculative investment means that you must only own 7.8k
2025-07-04 11:45:21,"What if your a normal middleclass guy? Do you have to pay taxes on it if you move it to ""cash"" if it hits a bankaccaunt. Im wondering that would be brutal lol.."
2025-07-04 22:46:23,Good to know! *makes notes*
2025-07-04 22:39:12,So you’re telling me there’s a special billionaire entrance at every bank?!
2025-07-04 16:21:19,Eight 10k transactions in the last 12-hours.
2025-07-08 08:11:55,"The same, I would have cashed out in 2015, 2018 and 2022, at least a little."
2025-07-05 01:00:12,"Not to Bitcoin itself, but possibly through a smart contract on another chain or not on blockchain at all, that unlocks these BTC wallets or triggers a transfer. It could also be a trust fund executing someone’s will, moving assets to beneficiaries after the original owner’s death."
2025-07-04 16:42:59,"Hah! It's hard for me to feel bad about it though because, even if I had saved the info, I'm sure I would have probably sold it for like $50."
2025-07-04 15:57:40,Facebook click bait post from his uncle
2025-07-04 13:26:07,"I'm just curios how such large sums could be realized into actual wealth. I mean, as of now, there are only limited ways to purchase stuff with BTC, so you'll be forced to exchange into FIAT at some point."
2025-07-04 08:19:56,Can never go wrong with Iraqi hookers
2025-07-04 08:19:44,"That's like a trillion hookers, you'll end up with a clit."
2025-07-04 10:13:08,"Would you share some details? Even if your BTC is held offshore, presumably, when it comes time to sell, you'll need to upload to an exchange (where, I assume you are KYC'd) and then sell into $$$. Then you'll need to extract your $$$ to a bank so you can buy the island, cover expenses, etc.. How to do this without the IRS noticing? 🤔"
2025-07-04 11:55:02,got super lucky on the vanity bitcoin address generator. i always wished.
2025-07-04 19:08:07,"I don't know, that's why I'm asking what the best answers would be. I have no idea how the taxman would deal with a case such as this one. I'd be surprised if the tax collector wouldn't want a piece of the pie."
2025-07-17 23:37:13,not many people have thousands to put into something “nobody wants” though… so it’s tough
2025-07-04 12:28:22,Ross Ulbricht probably has a load of Bitcoin stashed away somewhere and he just done ten years.
2025-07-04 09:53:20,But... Why not? It's like one chance in a few billion years. So there's a chance.
2025-07-04 10:56:55,*Money ball*
2025-07-04 14:14:00,Then im wrong.  Though I have known a few people who got rich off bitcoin and my one buddy did says he is still trying to sell it all and that its not easy if you want to take out any large amount.
2025-07-04 17:12:47,Yeah but not like it wasn't worth anything this time last year?
2025-07-04 18:10:57,Really? Someone drop me a wallet address I wanna see something that big on the blockchain too
2025-07-04 22:29:16,"Move to shit country for a year, cash out $1B and pay little to no taxes, then move back to USA."
2025-07-04 19:31:25,Ok let's say he wants to sell it. How do you get the $1billion?
2025-07-05 09:47:29,The idea is if you paste in the wrong address or something goes wrong you don't lose as much.
2025-07-04 21:08:45,How much would that have been?
2025-07-04 14:39:56,Long term cap gains tax will make him a millionaire
2025-07-04 14:44:05,Billionaire.
2025-07-07 18:19:39,He said that he has maintained at least half of the BTC.
2025-07-05 19:12:19,"OOOH SHIT, 10k BITCOIN!!! ok now thats a different story, WAIT, is that enough to mess with the price of bitcoin?"
2025-07-04 10:59:48,Same not existing things.
2025-07-04 13:43:14,Make this a real thing.
2025-07-04 16:09:21,That's the US government and when they sell the gig is up... people dont realize that if  there's Noone on the buy side your bitcoin that was worth 500k can be worthless in a blink.
2025-07-04 18:00:55,Lmaooo
2025-07-04 19:45:27,Omg I need this to exist. Run by ninja turtles.
2025-07-04 21:47:02,Shit mate you better patent that name lol
2025-07-04 22:17:13,Would you like the hodler combo? Bullsized?
2025-07-04 11:35:57,the fact that it was exactly 10.000 tells me that the pizza transaction was not about the value of the pizza.
2025-07-04 10:48:06,Notice how the first transaction shows $0?  It could be because instead of $ it was traded for pizza.
2025-07-04 12:53:36,"I bet that's a good pizza, well worth waiting for!"
2025-07-04 15:32:52,It was 15 years ago and for about $41 for the two pizzas.  No one knew the true potential of Bitcoin at the time.
2025-07-04 17:19:35,Ya if you look at how much Bitcoin was worth when he bought the pizza he overpaid by a stupid amount
2025-07-04 17:47:08,That's exactly the kind of thing I'd claim to troll people at a golf course about how I became rich when really I just snuck in. 
2025-07-04 14:38:37,"I don't mind telling one or two people at our golf course, glad he's keeping my name out of it"
2025-07-04 21:11:34,I was his golf caddie. I have to know his name. He was a member at the club I work at and doesn’t even want a member tag on his clubs with his name. Believe me or not but its true.
2025-07-04 13:40:36,Never been to a golf club? There are only so many people who go and even fewer members. It'd be difficult to keep a secret like that. 
2025-07-04 16:41:46,RoMar we used to call him
2025-07-04 21:24:14,Im  not. If the guy who told me it was him is lying thats on him but i worked at a club that cost $200k to join so I have no clue why this guy would feel the need to lie and even our head pro told me he’s the guy. He also paid me in bitcash for the round so it adds up. The guys name was Mike but i wont say his last name for obvious reasons.
2025-07-15 19:08:59,Could be a lost or recovered disk/phrase situation.
2025-07-04 08:51:40,"I mean, you do not even need to have extensive tech knowledge. Check that the entered address is correct. That's it. Would I still send 50 test transfers before? Oh hell yes."
2025-07-04 10:59:27,"I would split it up into 10-100, maybe even 1000 separate transactions.  Its just not worth the risk."
2025-07-04 14:32:48,though
2025-07-04 10:27:38,Its risky.... any mistake ur assed out
2025-07-04 12:35:48,Wanna be this guy has more btc?  A single 10k pizza...?   Surely this guy has to be one of the biggest whales
2025-07-04 12:41:31,given that the address he bought and sold to is the same it was probably sitting in an exchange where you just click a button to buy or sell
2025-07-04 13:21:32,It's funnier to imagine he's just some guy who's had this on a thumb drive and never thought about it in 14 years. He found it cleaning out a junk drawer and suddenly remembered that weird tech guy who wanted to tip him with digital funny money. Wonder if it's worth anything?
2025-07-04 14:41:36,I mean anyone can make a typo
2025-07-04 14:59:07,He's clearly pulling out. This is the end... as he sees it. And he's putting money where his mouth is. My advice is follow.
2025-07-04 17:57:26,"It’s still gambling a lot on a single point of failure. It should be fine, but why not move it big chunks just to be sure? It doesn’t really cost you anything at all, and takes almost no additional time. Just seems like the equivalent of not wearing a seatbelt to save the time of putting it on. High risk, no reward"
2025-07-05 00:08:45,My neighbor has used the wallet several dozen times and still does a test run before sending over like $100 USD worth
2025-07-04 12:09:17,Probably Vladimir ... sending Krasnov his summer allowance
2025-07-04 11:59:07,'currency of the future'
2025-07-04 10:27:21,As someone else here said: That was the test.
2025-07-04 19:54:04,"What would you be testing exactly? That you know how to do transactions? Well, he might have done dozens, we wouldn't know."
2025-07-08 23:11:32,I would have hired a fucking financial institution to audit and complete the process on my behalf and bought insurance on the the transaction
2025-07-04 14:02:01,"Why, what's the issue/challenge?"
2025-07-06 07:04:18,"It was probably an OTC sale, doubt it hits CEX"
2025-07-04 16:22:34,Dinald Trimp! I hate this guy! 
2025-07-04 12:49:07,He absolutely must've been really well off if he bought 10k BTC for 0.78 each as that's still a 7800 dollar investment.
2025-07-04 12:46:43,"Doesnt need to be rich tho. Just have enough money to not scrape by every month and it gets easier to hold off on selling, especially if you are a person with little needs/wants"
2025-07-04 15:04:41,My guess is the silk road guy who just got out of prison not too long ago
2025-07-04 15:42:30,I would have taken the wallet into a private bank and got several millions in loans using the wallet as collateral 
2025-07-04 18:34:58,My guess is he just got back into the wallet or something like that. 
2025-07-04 21:23:45,Maybe he went to jail
2025-07-05 00:48:36,"I don't know, to turn 0 into a billion requires 7 standard deviation level diamond hands. Maybe he has modest means and just let it ride. I'm with you, I'd cash out at a million but that's at least one reason I'm not worth a billion."
2025-07-04 12:49:09,"BTC was not 55k 10 years ago, though."
2025-07-04 16:48:51,Silk road lol
2025-07-04 13:35:51,Or they were in jail
2025-07-04 10:27:04,"Dude was probably in prison, maybe he’s an idiot is why he just sent em all at once🤣 still richer than us lmao"
2025-07-04 23:35:36,I sent $50 to the wrong address one time and I'm still fucking traumatized
2025-07-04 12:19:14,State actor.  This is the test transaction.  The rug pull is coming.
2025-07-04 09:39:46,What
2025-07-04 10:10:58,Least sexist cryptochud.
2025-07-04 18:18:18,If you put the wrong address (like with a typo) into a bitcoin transaction the money can vanish into the ether. That's why people use test transfers for a small amount most of the time before they transfer the bulk of their money.
2025-07-04 12:57:56,"Not the original commentor but......law enforcement seizes assets when they take down criminals. If some of those assets were computers with wallet info or cold storage wallets they would be in possession of the coins.  If a federal law enforcments agency wanted a billion or two they could use for clandestine operations without needing to request the money, give a reason for needing it, and detailing a budget which will out their clandestine operations to more and more people which leads to leaks they could cash in the bitcoin to fund it without having to read in another 50+ people into a classified op.  The CIA supplied the cocain that started the Crack epidemic in the 80s to fund clandestine ops. Selling seized bitcoin for funding would be them behaving lol.   It's also possible an actual countries government had sized wallets or coins sitting as an investment and decided to cash out to get the money."
2025-07-04 13:48:07,I mean huge sums of money that randomly got awaken sounds like a result of a  change in policy.   The average person doesn't behave like this and even private institutions don't just leave billions to rot  like that ...   Most likely this is US gov related 
2025-07-04 16:18:51,"It's a commonly held belief that Bitcoin was created by the US govt nowadays. If you bought and held a lot of bitcoin since 2011 you are probably a state actor as the only people interested in bitcoin back then were extremely smart hobbyist cryptographers on a forum that held a future asset that was designed to be spent and used as currency, while not impossible is fairly abnormal given human nature and what everyone thought bitcoin was going to do/be used for."
2025-07-04 19:30:12,Bro how much could this guy actually have in his wallet?
2025-07-04 08:56:15,"If They were a billionaire they probably wont even noticed, say you had 50b already another 1b in a backup is just for fun at this point."
2025-07-05 03:32:57,2 Billion backup fund... he moved 10K out of it twice today from what others are saying.
2025-07-04 18:41:03,The biggest candidate for a time traveller yet.
2025-07-04 13:41:50,14 years ago was 2011
2025-07-04 09:32:48,Maybe he wants to buy his favourite footbal club
2025-07-04 10:24:24,"I disagree, think of the Skyrim mods I could comission"
2025-07-04 10:37:13,The Lakers were just sold for $10Billion last week...  You're still short $9B here...
2025-07-04 20:54:06,Are you going to tell us how much he has now
2025-07-04 12:14:01,SR was founded a few months before this wallet got its coins which supports that theory.
2025-07-04 13:30:48,Many wallets have been seized over the years. A large percent of bitcoin has also been thought to be”lost” because of reasons. I would be surprised if governments didn’t have massive amounts of bitcoin including large amounts from dark web days.
2025-07-04 13:49:42,"No, the first time is crossed $100k was the end of 2024."
2025-07-04 10:54:11,not necessarily but a kind of ponzi scheme for sure
2025-07-04 15:09:23,That one is also in progress :)
2025-07-04 10:00:36,Tell me you don't know how quantum computing works without telling me 😂
2025-07-04 11:28:54,Trying to remember the pass phrase
2025-07-04 12:02:47,Waiting til people forgot about him.
2025-07-04 13:25:21,It would have been worth 980 million in January. Not enough for the 3 comma club.
2025-07-04 13:18:52,Waiting for it to hit 1B
2025-07-04 16:01:31,"Enjoying life with the millions he already had, I think in January someone on here somehow linked him to a wallet with like 40 million in it.   He definitely would have had more reason than most to keep his Bitcoin split between multiple wallets back then."
2025-07-05 11:14:00,memory alive shocking numerous marble hunt punch aware deserve frame   *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*

2025-07-04 18:06:48,20k BTC is small for his amount 10+ years ago and when compared to what they seized. Could have been a wallet authorities didn’t know about
2025-07-04 12:24:43,It's a paradox. The OP went back in time to this day to sell before the panic and inevitable drop but the drop is caused by him going back in time to sell
2025-07-04 11:14:27,You do know that the instant an apocalyptic scenario happens your BTC becomes worthless right?
2025-07-04 21:10:51,You just made me feel better about the issues in my life. I’m sorry
2025-07-04 21:16:58,"Similar story.  I still think it's a bubble, it just had a few more cycles than I assumed.  It won't be valuable forever."
2025-07-05 10:12:19,"Water under the bridge my dude. No point of spending energy on something you cannot change.   If not at $3, you would have sold at $10, $100 or perhaps $1000.  Also, that was kind of my point, once it started being worth real money the only rational thing is to take profits. Not many people left that held all the way when they could have sold."
2025-07-04 13:17:47,"I understand how it was back then, I also used BTC during the Silk Road days. Dead price action but sub 10$ during my days. Once something goes 100x however, it inevitably becomes an investment vehicle and everyone needs to make a choice based on that.   Curious though, since you were not an investor - you must have held until now and most likely be a millionaire? What’s your honest story with BTC?"
2025-07-04 14:08:57,"You're right that most smart investors would've sold some of it off and kept some, but most people that bought crypto back in the day weren't really investors, just tech enthusiasts, and many of them did sell way earlier than that. Very few people actually kept this amount of BTC around hence the post. Plus it's just extra juicy because apparently the guy didn't actually sell any of it until today."
2025-07-04 10:19:17,"Nope, brute-forcing a Bitcoin seed is close to impossible. Even with a trillion (1'000'000'000'000) computers each guessing a trillion seeds per second, it would take longer than the age of the universe to find one."
2025-07-04 15:53:00,"I remember having so much fuckin trouble myself. I think I bought one thing, and too chickened out after that."
2025-07-05 12:06:47,Damn dude maybe it's time to take a break and find center again.   Stay safe this weekend too.
2025-07-04 13:18:19,To me its unreal how much liquidity is in the market.
2025-07-04 21:20:55,Until the next major solar flare wipes out our grids and its utterly useless. Only a matter of time until one big enough to fuck everything up hits us.
2025-07-04 19:00:25,And encryption methods from two decades ago are archaic by today’s standards as well.
2025-07-05 01:10:18,Without a doubt people out there have that dooms day alert ready to go.
2025-07-04 13:42:11,Same.. only real use I saw for BTC until all this 'investment' talk was to buy drugs off silk road/AB/Dream etc etc  I know for a fact I've spent >10 BTC on weed and acid back in the day.
2025-07-04 11:47:18,"It's such a weird thing, it's not even a particularly useful currency compared to other crypto, it's literally just name recognition.

Trying to guess the right key by just picking random ones is like: 	•	closing your eyes, 	•	reaching into a giant ocean, 	•	and trying to grab one special drop of water… …but the ocean is the size of the whole universe!

2025-07-05 10:12:29,"But you can paste the right address in the test and the wrong address in the real transaction. The test proves nothing, and to perform the test, you have the load the private key into memory, which is where bad things can happen.   Anyway, the real concern for moving 8.6 billion dollars around (there were 7 more yesterday) is that one of the machines you're relying is compromised. Companies like Trezor built their reputation on having reliable devices, but Trezor isn't worth anything like 8.6 billion. The entire company could conpsire to steal a transaction like this and end up richer. And a sophisticated back door in Trezor could know to ignore the small ""test"" transactions and only steal the big ones, similar to how VW faked the diesel emissions tests.  Oh, and if all you're testing is whether you can copy and paste an address without corruption, the user may have done that test on a different address many times, we wouldn't see it."

Either this guy is super rich and this amount is pennies for him or his wallet just got hacked and he doesn't even know it.

2025-07-04 17:02:30,"I totally agree. That is a lot of money to put on what was a huge gamble. It was the equivalent of penny stock trading.

It's still a good idea to send a test transaction to see if something in your process is wrong especially when dealing with this kind of money. Splitting the risk is the logical thing to do. I've had to send hundreds of thousands of dollars in crypto before and there is no way I would have just one-shotted it. You're welcome to your opinion, but you won't change my mind.  As for Trezor, it's opensource so at the least you have external sources who review the code. Ledger on the other hand is closed source so that scenario is more likely to play out there."

Ie, you hire a builder to replace your roof. You owe the builder £5k. Then you receive an invoice for £5k, an invoice you were expecting, for money you do owe, labelled as coming a person you really hired, with fake details of who to pay (generally a mule's bank account).  So you send the money, and before the real invoice shows up the money is already out of the country and the mule account burned.  This has got a lot harder to do now that you mostly have to type the name of the person/business on the account as well (although this can be evaded, and not all banks require it), but it's still advised when sending large sums of money to send £1, check the person you actually wanted to pay got it over the phone, then send the rest."

2025-07-04 21:19:57,"> A state actor used this as a test of an active quantum computer breaking the bitcoin security protocol. They picked a particular wallet and cracked the encryption and took 10,000BTC as a proof of concept.  Ask any AI (or do the math yourself) but even if a state actor had a 10000 times faster quantum machine that also fixed the current error rate problem, and had one of those machines for every star in the universe (and a network, and power etc) it would still be over 10 million years to break a bitcoin private key"

Quantum computers are extremely specific to what they can do, the fact people are even remotely concerned about quantum computers cracking wallets shows complete lack of understanding. Theyre still figuring out how to add more qubits to the systems, so not even remotely close to having a stable enough system to even begin running these kinds of problems. You want more?"

You might not like the data but it includes things like cars, unrealized equity in a home, and retirement accounts. Each of these and things similar to them will be far less liquid than cash in the bank. Any other pertinent concrete numbers would be difficult to obtain.  https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm Federal Reserve Board - Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF)  I would agree though that the ‘average person on the street’ isn’t going to be the median person of a given age in the United States."

2025-07-04 18:29:13,But again that's not a lot of money to throw at an investment. What do you think unproven company stocks are? A company only becomes profitable once it's a proven thing before that it's stock is cheap.
2025-07-06 19:52:39,"Let's be real though. If you expect to make meaningful profits on your investments you are going to be spending more than a few hundred dollars to do so. If you want real returns you need to invest at minimum four figure amounts. If you can't afford to do that you can't afford to invest and would be better off putting that money in a growth account until it matures enough to actually be useful for investing. Frankly I think that 3000-8000 is a perfectly good amount to put into an investment you've done research on. It's enough that if it grows you will see returns, but not so much that if it doesn't you end up losing more than you can afford. Five figures plus investing is for proven growth vectors and if you are spending that kind of money on risky investments you are either very wealthy or very foolish, most likely both."
2025-07-04 18:00:38,"Yeah that’s the thing. Meme is maybe a bit too critical, but 7800 for a risky speculative investment in a new asset class is likely an indication that they had a huge amount in safer investments already. Otherwise they would have sold sooner, most likely"

2025-07-04 16:28:24,"That’s the point. They probably did exactly that - taking a copy of the public ledger and proving internally that they can break the one-way hash consistently. Then, they picked the hardest way to demonstrate they can.   Yes, it’s very tin foil hat, but I’ve said for years that crypto will crumble when real quantum computers are accessible. If there’s any modicum of potential to my thought, it would also coincide with a major hacking incident that may not be publicized (or even detected) with cryptographic encryption hijacking being the vector.   People are generally unaware of what a full potential quantum computer can do regarding the internet. Nearly all of the locked doors open up."
2025-07-04 09:30:52,"yes, they do, but it's rarely that much money. It's obviously a ridiculous amount of money for 99.99% of people, but like you said, it's hard to actually use that much cash.  Usually, the only time Billionaires see that much money is when liquidating assets to buy anoyher company, like Elon Musk did to twitter."

Yes, billionaires can borrow against their assets, but they can't just do that indefinitely, and the more they borrow, the more interest they have to pay. If you have $1 billion of liquid cash, that's much better than taking out a $1 billion loan, having to pledge your shares to secure it, having to pay interest and eventually having to pay back that loan, even if it's after their death."
2025-07-04 12:40:28,"All these coins coming off markets are pretty much impossible to cash out. And Ulbricht wasn't that extremely ahead and smarter than Agents to think of everything and keep stashing wallets away. People forget this guy tried to order murders.  There's a case in Czech where an owner of 2 darknet markets got released from prison and asked to get his electronics back, then gave 40M$ in bitcoin to the government (ministers had to resign) to use it as a leverage that his coins are clean and not came from criminal activity. Exchanges still don't touch that coin and he can't change the bitcoin into money. If he finds a person to change with it, that person won't be able to change it into money. It's highly unlikely these coins are from criminal activity.   Think in terms of the money it was before, back in the days you won't be making 100 different backups with random bitcoin amounts because it was worth a few thousand at best then."

2025-07-04 11:17:58,"So why wouldn't it be returned to the sender? For the ""currency of the future"", that seems utterly stupid."
2025-07-04 10:46:53,"I was gonna say, it makes no sense that there wasn't a checksum digit or something. However it's still important to do the test transaction just to ensure you're not copying someone else's wallet by mistake."
2025-07-04 09:38:33,"Why didn’t the creator just make it so… “Beep boop, address does not exist, your Bitcoin has been returned to your wallet.”"
2025-07-06 17:28:20,So why are they taking it seriously now?
2025-07-04 23:13:51,"You want to name a bunch of current unproven stocks that are surging or were surging before the market got Trumped?  When you invest in dirt cheap stocks you are taking a risk that the comps will actually go somewhere and not belly up within the next 5 years. I'm not saying it's exactly a one for one with Bitcoin just that throwing several thousand at something new and unproven isn't exactly a new idea. I'm also not saying that the investor isn't rich before their investment simply that it's not like they dropped six or even five figures into it. It was a sub five figures investment, that's nothing in the investment world."
2025-07-05 07:08:30,"Yes it does imply they are comfortable enough not to touch the money. Can't imagine their *only* investment was $8k of bitcoin, that would be insane."
2025-07-04 13:48:21,"That's your attitude to your money (and a reasonable one) , but it isnt a universal truth. There are people who are more risk-on with their cash and will put more bets out on a range of stuff to see what sticks. The fact is that it wasn't ""definitely"" literally burning money, because it's now worth billions. It was a high risk punt with a high chance of turning 8k into 0k, but if you have 100k and the rest of it is low risk, you can actually afford to do that if you want to"

2025-07-06 18:22:24,"I have no idea what the majority of people think about bitcoin, but your point that people do believe in it supports what I was saying - although it had a reputation as a meme to people who weren't familiar with it or didn't think it was investable, it was taken very seriously by others."
2025-07-04 16:06:01,And you think you need to have $10 million net worth to have $7800 cash to invest?
2025-07-04 11:37:02,Yes you tell us off how dare we leave the kitchen and bed

2025-07-04 17:33:41,It’s entirely related homie. You elect how you feel.
2025-07-05 01:03:30,"1) ""quantum-safe"" is a lot easier to say than to do  2) no, they can't. Everyone who has Bitcoin would have to independently decide to move. A different cryptocurrency that's ""quantum-safe""? That's at least tenable, but we won't know if any algorithms are quantum safe until quantum exists and they actually resist nation-states with quantum computers."

2025-07-04 18:31:47,"So instead of spending 1 pizza to get 10,000BTC you had to spend 2. The price of 10kBTC in pizzas doubled. That’s 100% inflation."

2025-07-04 11:22:11,This will not be the last time you feel like this if you start looking into how Bitcoin actually works.
2025-07-04 12:18:18,"If the addressed is invalid, the transaction will not be executed, and no money is lost. These people are talking bullshit."
2025-07-04 11:46:30,"If you actually do your own research and learn how Bitcoin actually works, you’ll realize how dumb it is and why it’s not the future of anything.   In the best case scenario calling Bitcoin the future of money is like calling ham radio the future of communication, when we already have cell phones."
2025-07-04 13:24:38,"it won't send at all, because the destination address will be considered invalid if it has a bad checksum"
2025-07-04 16:37:59,"If it doesn't pass the checksum it doesn't get sent in the first place so there's nothing that has to be ""returned""."
2025-07-04 17:47:38,"if you put in an address it sends it to that address, how is it supposed to know you put in the wrong address?"
2025-07-04 18:28:03,It won't be returned to sender because transaction without matching checksum won't even be processed in the first place. Basically your wallet won't let you send your money to invalid adress
2025-07-04 09:48:29,That is what happens the transaction will fail.  You can't just change a digit and have it be a valid address that has to pass checksum
2025-07-04 10:31:35,Because where's the fun in that? Where's the *thrill*? Where's the *DANGER?*  Gotta have something to get the blood in your brain flowing.
2025-07-04 12:20:57,"If it isn't a valid address then it won't send. If it is a valid address, but it's not the address you wish to send to, then it's working correctly.  If the users messes up the address they have entered (maybe they thought they clicked copy but didnt, then pasted in a previous address for example....or if you're on a compromised machine and there is some malware which recognises you're pasting a btc address, so it replaces it with the attackers address instead for example).  In these cases, it's acting as it should, it's upto the user to ensure they are sending it to a correct address.  If I go to buy a car, and im sitting there with my bank app, I can absolutely send the payment to the wrong recipient by also inputting the incorrect details, then the payment will be sent to the wrong person too. I have bought a car privately before, the first transaction from my online banking has still been £5 to test that the private seller receives it, before sending thousands across afterwards...this is no different.  What is different is that you might be able to get the account owner details via a bank so you can go ask them to send it back / reverse it, which requires their approval. The banks can only step in and reverse it if it is fraud, user error is not fraud. Btc bring decentralised doesn't have this, which is a just how decentralised things work, you dont have the bank in the middle - there are reasons why that's good and bad depending on your outlook, but that's a completely different discussion and not one I'd have with someone who hasnt first educated themselves in how it works (this isn't a jab at anyone, I just wouldn't explain the full intricacies and opinions on something with someone who hasnt got a base level of understanding of the tech/topic etc - it's just not worth my time to ensure that they have that base level of understanding).  Companies are there which give more assistance, ensuring via several checks that you're doing what you want to do, but usually that's because youve entrusted said company to hold your bitcoin/keys for you.  In essence, it's user error. The tech of the future (apply this to anything) requires users to know wtf they are doing, else it wouldn't be new, it would just be the old."
2025-07-04 13:11:54,"> Why didn’t the creator just make it so… “Beep boop, address does not exist, your Bitcoin has been returned to your wallet.”  Because Bitcoin has no registry of “existing” addresses—just hashes of possible keys. So the network can’t return coins; it simply records transfers. The checksum blocks ~99.99999997% of typos. Only ~0.00000003% of random errors hit a valid address and don’t lose the coins."
2025-07-04 13:26:54,"Because that would involve somehow assigning new addresses to people, instead of letting them create their own as needed, which would affect a lot of how it works."
2025-07-04 16:39:35,Doesn't have to be returned. It won't get sent in the first place.
2025-07-04 09:49:08,Cause 2011 isnt 2025... The knowledge around crypto today vs 2011 is not even comparable... 2011 was literally a peanut shell...
2025-07-04 17:37:32,im never investing in something I can't tangibly touch. It comes with being poor as a kid. I just cant comprehensibly invest in shit. I know its wrong. I'd rather just build housing than invest in intangibles.
2025-07-04 11:58:45,"Life is tough, and things could be better, but they likely won't be so, be tougher, so that at the very least in part you can experience the true wonders that this life can offer."
2025-07-04 19:24:14,"I don't know what your thought process is but it is unreasonable. Electing depends on how you actually vote and what your interactions with others encourage them to think and do and even then it's unlikely people will change their decisions just from one person's singular action. Media companies sway voters more than any person could ever manage on their own. The many factors that encourage someone to make the decision to vote for a certain leader and the same factors that allow said leader to keep their position, not even taking into account the possibility of rigged elections, which are common nowadays, perhaps unbeknownst to you. An extreme (according to you) reaction to something that did not sound like a joke at first has little to do with the presidential election of the United States. No, you do not ""elect how you feel"" just because you do something that might have some semblance of relation, not when it does not even directly correlate to that something, at the very least, certainly not in this case."

2025-07-05 01:47:27,"Yes, he's a person"
2025-07-04 14:16:56,But that’s not how it works. With an invalid address the BTC doesn’t just disappear. The transfer doesn’t get validated.
2025-07-04 12:09:06,Tulips!!!
2025-07-05 10:01:51,It had to be said. Crypto bros dont like to hear it.
2025-07-05 18:56:46,"Serious: do you use bitcoin/buy it/trade it/hodl it/whatever? I’m assuming that you do, so I’m curious what the short reason you feel that way is. I mean I intuitively can tell it’s a pain to transfer and use etc, but I’m wondering if there’s more to your take cuz it seems like u have more thoughts on it."
2025-07-04 13:42:01,This is what someone who hasn't done any research would say.
2025-07-04 16:34:23,The conversation was about Bitcoin...
2025-07-04 21:51:41," It's okay if you were poor in your childhood. But it's not fine that you haven't done the homework and learned about money and what makes it tick. Therefore you will stay poor by trying to save your depreciating fiat in depreciating assets. Fortunately there's still time, I'd give a couple decades until it can be considered ""too late"", as in your fiat is worthless and can't buy you any sats. Take your time."

2025-07-04 13:39:41,Framed? The fact that he's talking with undercover agents about the murders doesn't mean he didn't want them to be done.
2025-07-04 10:51:23,Good luck with your $500 shitcoin investment and asking mom to drive you places.
2025-07-04 20:26:22,I can agree with 50% loss in value. That’s not the same as inflation though.
2025-07-06 13:50:46,“Insane”? That’s an interesting use of the word.  Your comment history is just you berating others and name calling. Narcissist much? Not worth engaging.
2025-07-05 02:43:12,"The Federal Reserve is not a person. Jerome Powell is, and that much money is a FUCK TON to him."
2025-07-05 21:16:45,"I used it up until 2017 when it actually started to be widely used. Transaction fees exploded higher, I wanted to know why. I figured out why and realized that it’s complete garbage. There’s a reason there has been 0 adoption for payments since 2017, because the network is incapable of being a payments network. So now it’s instead been touted as digital gold and 99% of Bitcoin owners have never even used the network, they just buy on a centralized exchange. Which begs the question, why is this valuable at all? Nobody uses the network, nobody runs nodes, every single benefit of Bitcoin is null when you just hold on an exchange. The network needs billions of in revenues to keep secure each year, and right now nobody is paying for that, the block subsidy is. Eventually that will run out and there is 0% chance fees will rise to meet it. We have a long enough history to know what happens with fees, they will temporarily spike higher on occasion and then fall back to near zero. This is true now and will still be true in the future. All those people who just hold on a centralized exchange certainly aren’t going to be paying transaction fees, and users have proven they will not pay high fees for any extended period of time."
2025-07-04 14:49:15,I probably know a lot more about Bitcoin than you do.
2025-07-04 22:21:00,"lol im not gonna keep my fiat. Everything goes into bricks. Im not gonna hoard fiat like a dumbass. But for me the only asset worht investing is something tangible. You do you, if you're fine with the anxiety that comes with giving your money to a bank, and then trust that money to a company you have no relations with, nah, that's crazy talk for me. I'll build appartments, i'll rent them, and if they don't pay i'll in time it'll be shotgun time."

2025-07-06 06:42:50,"To the point. Thanks. For years, it was pitched for international transfers, now as digital gold - lol. Another point is that the legal owner is the one who has the keys. Think of all the compute power governments or secret services have at their hands - including quantum computing. It literally uses SHA by the NSA. I'm not a fan of the legacy banking system, but most crypto is likely a Trojan horse or straight scam. Where does its value come from other than scarcity and hope. My shit is also unique and scarce, only can make a fixed amount of it per day. It's high price because certain institutions or governments want it high for whatever reasons, certainly not in the interest of common people.  IMO, take it or leave it."
2025-07-06 08:09:42,Thank you so much for sharing your perspective.
2025-07-04 15:23:19,Probably not.

You actually spend your time thinking about how people poop and pee while at their job and not just that, you create Reddit posts about it too. So strange. Creepy really."
2025-07-07 02:29:38,gj stalking me boi i think you are the weird one... now back to your basement ;)
2025-02-17 16:51:29,"I don’t even think that person was trying to hype ETH or shit talk BTC, I think the joke was just that they didn’t like their job and would quit for even less lol."

2025-02-17 14:53:20,I’d quit for 3 LTC
2025-02-17 15:00:15,This is how all of reddit is. Losers with too much control over a community will ban you if you say anything they don't like. Literally every subreddit

I WAS RIGHT HOLY HELL, EAT SHIT GRANDMA! YOU GET THE PRICE YOU DESERVE YOU BROKE MOTHER FUCKERS, SAY HELLO TO YOUR NEW ELITE!”"

2025-02-17 15:40:53,i'd quit for 3 upvotes
2025-02-17 14:59:50,This is what PISSES me off about Reddit.  Each subreddit USUALLY has some bullshit moderator that flexes their micro penis on people that don’t deserve it.  I’ve been banned in more subreddits I can count just for saying counter ideas/opinions.  This is why there’s no accurate political polls we live in echo chambers.

2025-02-17 14:46:24,I am a bitcoin maxi and I got banned from there. They are all regarded.
2025-02-17 15:19:15,The worst part of the crypto community is that there is no crypto community.
2025-02-17 15:34:46,That is a religious subreddit. Bitcoin is a religion.
2025-02-17 15:54:28,Bitcoin sub permabanned me for less. I used to be really active there in 2017. I guess they got new mods because it’s turned to garbage.   Just as bad as buttcoin now
2025-02-17 15:01:35,Wtf is wrong with these moderators. Even on wallstreet bets the moderators act like narcisists. It's just a reddit moderator thing to be weird?
2025-02-17 15:09:56,It’s r/bitcoin. Not r/btc.  And people have been exposing their censorship for years.
2025-02-17 14:34:52,i honestly meant that as a kind of “i would quit for less” joke but the mods were too fun for that

2025-02-17 15:19:35,Yes i would. I would even start traveling using staking rewards.
2025-02-17 16:03:18,lol ridiculous. Sounds like a bunch of over sensitive insecure moderators
2025-02-17 16:07:45,Mods on next level bullshit
2025-02-17 17:30:20,Reddit mods remind me of those people who have the smallest amount of power go to their head.
2025-02-17 17:58:53,"Wow, that is bad.   Especially with the type of tongue in cheek comment that it was.   It literally had little to nothing to do with Eth at all. Had no opinion on it whatsoever. It was a funny comment about how little buddy would take to leave his job. Topical and accessible joke on any crypto sub."
2025-02-17 18:21:05,The mods of Bitcoin think Ethereum is a scam?!   I hold both BTC and ETH and think both are great for different purposes. Talk about bullshit brainwashed abuse of power by the mods over there!
2025-02-17 22:34:45,"Mods who mute with ban should be removed from reddit. Clear abuse of power, it is crazy how reddit does nothing about it."
2025-02-19 10:31:42,"I like how it bans you publicly, with such a clear response, because many subs will shadow ban you, you still see your comments when you log in but no one on the sub will see your comments except you, that's the insult, but this sub only bans you temporarily, and you are notified clearly and transparently."
2025-02-17 14:47:34,EPIC reply xD
2025-02-17 15:07:26,Yes and I would then get a new job somewhere else
2025-02-17 15:23:44,i have quit for less
2025-02-17 15:24:16,The Bitcoin sub is full of cult-like minded people.
2025-02-17 15:29:24,"No big loss, that subreddit sucks. Not just because of this type of censorship which is commonplace over there, but almost everyone on that sub says stupid shit like ""Bitcoin isn't crypto"" all the time."
2025-02-17 15:29:37,Lmao seems someone had a bad day.. maybe not the best person for moderating.
2025-02-17 15:29:43,"Holy shit. That dude is the biggest, softest, and limpest weenie of human I’ve ever seen lmfao. I hope they see this thread."
2025-02-17 15:38:35,This is so hilarious LMAO
2025-02-17 15:38:54,Mod is literally a loser irl holy....maybe somebody cucked his anime pillow
2025-02-17 15:59:35,These subs are getting worse and worse with the permanent bans. I’ve been banned from like 5 in the past month. Complete BS
2025-02-17 16:13:17,"Bitcoin sub must be terrible. I understand blocking, removing, or ban if some major thing. But banning because you simply said eth? That's crazy, it almost makes me want to be petty and coordinate a mass sub, post frenzy on them."
2025-02-17 16:17:09,I'm not a fan of Eth at all but I don't get this. That's childish
2025-02-17 16:17:52,That's impressive. Echo chambers be nuts these days.
2025-02-17 16:18:11,Reddit moment

2025-02-17 17:07:19,"Gotta love an echo chamber, actually pathetic...  Your comment came across as more of a joke than anything. Quitting for $7k is not worth it unless you could another job really fast."
2025-02-17 17:10:30,That's Reddit in two pictures. Moderator stupidity reigns.
2025-02-17 17:12:40,"I'd quit take the money, then go get a new job."
2025-02-17 17:21:00,/r/Bitcoin is run by clowns.   In fact every subreddit is.

2025-02-17 18:20:27,"PERMA banned for first post? No warning or temporary ban just ""boom, straight to jail"""
2025-02-17 18:25:08,That sub reddit will ban you for the dumbest things
2025-02-17 18:37:46,"Btc community is bunch of crazy people. Nothing new. With prices going up, their egos go up tripletime.  I am so looking for a day when absence of innovation gets to them."
2025-02-17 18:39:06,Always love the perma ban with the added mute so they don’t have to try and defend their sassy power flex
2025-02-17 19:06:53,some pathetic people out there man.
2025-02-17 19:16:54,It was clearly a simple joke. I don't get what they gain by banning him.

2025-02-17 20:41:26,I would quit for 3 ethereum!
2025-02-17 21:37:40,"No way, that’s not enough. I’d need multiple years salary."
2025-02-17 22:05:39,"Loser slapfight. After Silk Road got taken down all you can do with bitcoin - or any coin - is launder money and speculate, hoping you find a bigger loser to sell to.  Eventually the bubble pops and most of you fuckers will be left holding the bag. This shit can't grow forever, someday people will stop buying and then it all goes down. All you can bloody do is build hype and sell to he next loser who does the same thing over a speculative asset with negative actual value to the one planet we have.  And it's mostly owned by the rich Wall Street bastards it was founded to oppose. Its mainstream, its the new scam of the capital class to fuck with the poor. Either you got in day 1 and got rich or were already rich and bought in to the human centipede hype train.  All a fucking rat race and that doesn't even mention the literal cultist subcultures lol thinking gamestop will be worth trillions and the world will give all its money to like a few thousand nerds. News flash - if moass was real the cia would have blackbagged all you secret quadrillionares lmao"

2025-02-18 00:03:22,3 bitcoins is less then 300k
2025-02-18 02:37:51,3 dogecoin and you got a deal
2025-02-18 03:06:24,That sub is run by utter morons. I’d say they’re 85% of the reason Bitcoin has no adoption today.
2025-02-18 06:17:41,Going to go troll for you op
2025-02-18 10:38:09,"Absolute cinema, glad I got notified of this post"
2025-02-18 10:57:43,"Nice repost, but a little credit would be cool! 😅"
2025-02-18 12:45:29,"What a dogshit moderator. Some people are just on a power trip  This kind of reminds me of the most unhinged moderator I ever encountered. I think it was r/cringe or r/cringepics or something  I had a minor disagreement with someone and they started replying with some crazy overreactions that made no sense in context.  It went something like:  Me: X doesn’t always mean Y, it could be Z  Them: How could you be so vile and toxic? It’s people like you that make people scared to come here. I don’t feel safe. There’s no need for personal attacks. I don’t know why you’d post something so insulting, etc. etc.  Me: What the hell are you talking about?  A couple of minutes later all of my comments got deleted, so their reactions would look like a reasonable response to something morally outrageous. They got a tonne of upvotes consoling them and asking what I’d said. I’m convinced this was an alt account of one of the mods because they also deleted the comments I made calling them out and trying to show everyone my original comments  Still boggles my mind that someone would be pathetic enough to go that far, but they were  Later I heard that someone had made a new sub citing the awful moderation and I immediately knew what they were talking about"
2025-02-18 16:51:36,Yes
2025-02-19 06:37:23,Pathetic Sub
2025-02-19 13:16:19,CRIIIIINGE REDDIT MODS
2025-02-19 13:30:44,"This is crazy, anyone can tell it was a joke saying that they would quit for less"
2025-02-19 19:18:56,The mods at the bitcoin subredddit are wussies. They banned me because I called one a crypto bro after he was boasting about his gains.
2025-02-17 14:42:37,"Those subreddits are the worst BTC: mention another coin, get banned instantly XRP: 10k$ a coin, mcap doesn‘t matter for XRP SOL: did I get rugged?"
2025-02-17 14:42:49,that's kinda not okay from the mods
2025-02-17 14:50:58,"The average reddit mod is hilarious, it's the smallest amount of power I've ever seen go to someone's head lol"
2025-02-17 14:57:51,It's so obviously sarcasm.  I would have said it's a bot that banned you. but then I saw  that ridiculous message you received.
2025-02-17 14:59:39,This mod is prob an incel
2025-02-17 15:01:32,"What the actual fuck is wrong with some mods on reddit, and why is there no control mechanism for them?"

2025-02-17 15:10:49,"HA! Suckers, I'd do it for free"
2025-02-17 15:11:53,I got banned for saying I'd push a guy over once. I was insighting violence apparently. It was a video of a homeless man hitting g cars with a hammer if they didn't give him change.
2025-02-17 15:11:58,Already did

2025-02-17 15:17:52,The mods there have some ridiculous rules. Even a mention of another coin is banworthy. But you can freely mention any fiat. Why is that?
2025-02-17 15:19:59,Maybe
2025-02-17 15:24:46,Haha that's insane.. mods slurping up the power.  Solid joke man

2025-02-17 16:56:08,Who isn't going to quit for 10 years salary at minimum wage in Bitcoin. Or like 3 years salary as a coding developer in Bitcoin.
2025-02-17 16:56:39,I’d say I’m shocked by their fragility but sadly this platform reminds me every day these people not only exist but are in a position of power. I do love plenty of subreddits but the bulk is just embarrassing at this point.
2025-02-17 16:58:58,Give me 3 PEPE I'll make it work

2025-02-17 17:06:57,This happened to me too. I mentioned Fartcoin as a joke and now I'm banned from r/bitcoin.
2025-02-17 17:08:06,I think it's time for an AI-moderated social media platform.  It's insane that permanent bans can be handed out over something so trivial.
2025-02-17 17:09:56,Top signal
2025-02-17 17:11:26,"There's still r/btc there's no censorship there, and especially no idiot bans. you could even mention Doge, XMR, BTC, BCH, Nano... Whatever and openly discuss with arguments and stuff.  The good thing about that corrupted sub, is that it will impulse more people to know the version of bitcoin that kept true to its values."
2025-02-17 17:12:07,I would quit my job for 1 bitcoin lol
2025-02-17 17:15:32,Not right now. Maybe 2030.

2025-02-17 17:41:29,I have been to the Philippines and checked prices of housing in the provinces. I take the 3 bitcoin and start a new live there… but in Germany 300k will just help me to buy a nice house
2025-02-17 17:41:54,Sounds accurate for a bitcoin max subreddit
2025-02-17 17:42:19,Give me 3 BC and let’s find out
2025-02-17 17:43:34,lol wtf you can’t even mention other cryptos. It’s not like you made a post about Ethereum..
2025-02-17 17:43:58,That’s not that much money as an adult. The OP must be 16.
2025-02-17 17:51:31,I take 3 solana and I’m out too
2025-02-17 17:51:44,I’d quit my job for free
2025-02-17 17:51:51,That reasoning. :D  The older I get the more I notice that too many adults are defined by physical growth of the body only.  It is actually quite depressing because it is to be seen everywhere.
2025-02-17 17:55:06,That makes me want to liquidate my BTC and yolo it into alts
2025-02-17 17:55:52,They banned me for trolling. To be fair I do be trolling but still
2025-02-17 17:57:32,"""...wrong subreddit *bud*.""  Hit 'em with *bud*. Is the mod someone's goofy 90's sitcom uncle?"
2025-02-17 17:57:37,not quitting for 3 eth id quit for 3 btc though
2025-02-17 17:58:48,"i got banned from r/xrp for saying i like xrp but will only hold short term not long term   makes me feel like i cant listen to any opinions from any of the specific crypto subs bc any ""negativity"" is automatically banned"

2025-02-17 18:03:19,I don't think I it would even take one ethereum coin to get me to quit. I already hate my job and plan to quit soon.
2025-02-17 18:05:31,#bitcoin mods are soft
2025-02-17 18:06:19,power hungry mods that  need to prove how strong they are ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  and to stupid to get the joke  ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|scream)  edit: lol got banned from r/xrp guess they saw this comment and did not understand the etherjoke lol   cause i did not post anything there the past days and just got banned
2025-02-17 18:07:21,"LOL, they did the same to me. I just mentioned Ethereum under someone's comment. Was banned in seconds.  r/Bitcoin turned into one of the most toxic places on reddit. Someone should mod the mods there.  Ethereum is a premined scam? WTF. Are the mods there 9? Anyway, jump ship to r/btc"
2025-02-17 18:07:47,No

2025-02-17 18:15:54,Cryptobros being unable to tell political statements apart from people being sick of working.  This country is in GREAT hands.
2025-02-17 18:25:24,I’d do it for a cheeseburger
2025-02-17 18:25:44,Dumbshit.
2025-02-17 18:29:09,Surely once all Bitcoin is mined people will switch to ETH or will they do a cheaper one?
2025-02-17 18:29:39,"With the way things have been going lately, I’d quit for 1 SHIB if I wasn’t risking having to sleep outside in the snow."
2025-02-17 18:30:06,I'd quit for 3 doge coins and a slice of pizza 😂
2025-02-17 18:33:32,I dont understand. Why were they banned?
2025-02-17 18:34:12,"That wasn't lucky imo. They usually do allow speaking of alts in the comments, just no posts about it. Its not the level of r/xrp usually...   https://i.redd.it/2a7w59mxtqje1.gif"
2025-02-17 18:35:21,What job ?
2025-02-17 18:35:39,Bitcoin sub is very very sensitive.  I made a crypto currency ponzi scheme joke and they perma banned me too.

2025-02-17 18:47:35,I’m crying 😂
2025-02-17 18:49:20,For some reason I also think I got banned at one point and I didn’t even do anything other than laugh at something.
2025-02-17 18:49:29,https://i.redd.it/vtddaaunwqje1.gif
2025-02-17 18:51:05,3 bitcoins is like almost $300k. If you are making $50k a year it’s gonna take you 6 years to make that much money. Fuck yeah I’ll quit my job for 3 BTC

2025-02-17 18:53:44,I’d quit for 3 tron

2025-02-17 18:57:37,God Reddit can suck a cocky sometimes
2025-02-17 18:58:47,I would quit for 3 dogecoin
2025-02-17 19:00:50,/r/bitcoin needs to be banned unless this is reversed and the mod kicked out.  For better or worse it’s a large recourse for information.
2025-02-17 19:01:24,lol omg.  Give some loser the \*tiniest\* bit of power and he can't wait to abuse it.
2025-02-17 19:01:28,That guy should be stripped of his mod privileges
2025-02-17 19:01:32,I would quit for 3
2025-02-17 19:01:56,The mods there are very fragile. It's common in Reddit. Just ignore em.
2025-02-17 19:03:08,I would quit my job for three Solana
2025-02-17 19:03:59,I would quit my job  if you asked me nicely
2025-02-17 19:07:24,"Reddit mods suck, a tale as old as time."
2025-02-17 19:10:04,BRING IT ON!!
2025-02-17 19:12:42,That’s dumb as hell. Some mods are kids with too much imaginary power.
2025-02-17 19:13:33,Yes - a bird in the hand
2025-02-17 19:14:50,How do I get banned from this sub? It keeps coming up and I’m to lazy to mute or block this bullshit.
2025-02-17 19:15:06,Sheltered basement dwellers with sheltered lives.
2025-02-17 19:15:51,I would quit for 3 dogecoin
2025-02-17 19:16:45,Avg reddit mod

2025-02-17 19:41:49,No…
2025-02-17 19:44:00,I got banned for saying trump coin was a rug pull
2025-02-17 19:44:34,Calling one coin a scam while thinking yours is a new untouchable currency. Priceless!
2025-02-17 19:44:54,Bud feels like the new R-Word
2025-02-17 19:45:09,"Just quit my job, what do I do now"
2025-02-17 19:46:32,I quit my job for a meatball sub
2025-02-17 19:47:24,Yes
2025-02-17 19:47:52,were you not poking fun at ethereum? what a bullshit ban
2025-02-17 19:50:39,"This is insane. Great to know how much truth there is, To it being an echo chamber."
2025-02-17 20:07:27,"This comment could be read 2 different ways.      1 - you think so highly of ethereum and so low of bitcoin that you value 1 ethereum as more than 1 bitcion - ex, I would ONLY quit for 3 ethereum, not 3 bitcoin (which would be pretty weird to post in the r/bitcoin subreddit)     2 - you hate your job so much you'd quit for like 3% of what the original question was, which is a funny joke especially for a community that hates alt coins - ex, I would quit for 0.03 bitcoin     seems like the mods assumed it was 1"
2025-02-17 20:17:00,Absolutely not
2025-02-17 20:17:23,Would quit for 3 fartcoin
2025-02-17 20:21:01,Is it really ban worthy? Guy was just joking fs.
2025-02-17 20:35:12,Fuck reddit 😁
2025-02-17 20:36:10,Yup
2025-02-17 20:37:02,That's a lot of centralized decision making for someone that loves their decentralized money
2025-02-17 20:45:46,"That’s literally how I got banned from XRP subreddit. Someone said this bull run will hit $100 and I replied “ wishful thinking, it’ll probably be closer to $5”"
2025-02-17 20:46:09,I would quit my job for 50 Trump 😥
2025-02-17 20:47:05,"Lolololol soft, cowardice pussies"
2025-02-17 20:50:27,Reddit mods are the absolute worst. On like every sub
2025-02-17 20:52:08,"Can we actually get those mods removed? They’re harming the credibility of crypto in general, which is already shaky on a good day."
2025-02-17 20:52:36,I got banned from the NFL sub for 2 weeks because I said I didn’t want to watch the Super Bowl. Some of these communities are run by tyrant losers.
2025-02-17 20:52:55,On par for that circle jerk sub
2025-02-17 20:57:15,Ouch. That rubbed them the wrong way. That was a massive overreaction and taken out of context.
2025-02-17 20:57:33,that moderator should be elon mask
2025-02-17 20:59:21,"Ah yes, BTC maxis. True libertarians."

2025-02-17 21:25:13,Im unemployed so sure
2025-02-17 21:34:33,"Yes,  yes I would. U need my wallet or what? Send me the 3 btc and you can Truman show me."
2025-02-17 21:36:11,*Laughs in ALGO. *
2025-02-17 21:39:04,"Don’t worry bro, I got banned for the Xrp one for some arbitrary reason too lol. They all like this.! I guess the idea of freedom that blockchain inspired isn’t reflected in the subreddit"
2025-02-17 21:41:22,"I got banned for the exakt same reason, some BTC maxis is just… insane. And judging by the way this mod wrote, i honestly think its the same guy. What a sad human."
2025-02-17 21:44:14,Yep
2025-02-17 21:50:49,Imagine thinking that Bitcoin is decentralized
2025-02-17 22:02:48,100%. $300 will take me 2 years to spend.
2025-02-17 22:06:44,BTC maxis are fucking stupid
2025-02-17 22:09:47,"I mean yeah, crypto bros are weird as fuck dog what you expect?"
2025-02-17 22:20:30,Wow.

2025-02-17 22:31:34,No.
2025-02-17 22:35:23,again?
2025-02-17 22:37:40,L mod
2025-02-17 22:44:39,"I am a artist from Romania, if you give me 2 bitcoins, I will quit everiting I do, and start dressing up like Jesus and go around the world an convince people that Bitcoin comes from god ;)"
2025-02-17 22:45:35,If someone give me 3 piece chicken nuggets I will quit on spot rn
2025-02-17 22:46:06,"It’s actually a great question, the answer kind of defines the difference between the actual working middle class, the working shit poor we pretend are middle class and not peasantry, and the ownership class. I myself am shit poor and sometimes working, but it’s irrelevant because class mobility is out of reach at this point."
2025-02-17 22:47:33,That’s absolutely bullshit
2025-02-17 22:51:00,Dummy doesn't get the joke. Right over his silly head. Good reddit mod material though.
2025-02-17 22:55:39,I guess yes
2025-02-17 23:04:33,"Not my current job, but some of my past bullshit jobs…..hell yeah!  Seeeee ya!"
2025-02-17 23:19:03,I didn’t want to laugh cause that was messed up but at the same time it was funny.
2025-02-17 23:25:50,Heck yes I would
2025-02-17 23:27:00,Mods flaming ETH made me laugh.
2025-02-17 23:33:30,"Can't interfere with the hypetrain, that's people's money."
2025-02-17 23:33:33,I'm willing to quit if anyone wants to throw 3 BTCs my way.
2025-02-17 23:45:07,What a pathetic person.
2025-02-17 23:48:33,I got banned from /Bitcoin too for mention ETH. Such fucking dipshits over there. I’m bullish on BTC but ETH is obviously not the same as shitcoins
2025-02-17 23:55:44,It's called a sign on bonus
2025-02-17 23:58:05,womp womp
2025-02-18 00:16:55,oooo sensitive souls over there!
2025-02-18 00:23:03,3 cumrockets baby
2025-02-18 00:26:01,Seems mods should get banned instead.
2025-02-18 00:38:41,No but tempting
2025-02-18 00:39:05,For 2 even 1 probably
2025-02-18 00:43:29,"I would quit for 3 Solana, and fight with my brothers in the trenches."
2025-02-18 00:45:29,3 ? You’re nuts . At least 20 btc
2025-02-18 00:45:56,This is basically the whole story of Reddit in two pictures.
2025-02-18 00:47:52,Sounds about right. At least 40% of subs have at least one mod who acts the same way this incel does.
2025-02-18 00:55:38,A true battle of the shit coins. Bitcoin is for boomers
2025-02-18 00:58:09,This type of things is why reddit is being used less and less.
2025-02-18 01:11:29,I got banned from Buttcoin for talking about Blockchain.
2025-02-18 01:17:17,Something tells me 90% of people in that subreddit doesn't even have a single bitcoin
2025-02-18 01:23:22,Reddit sucks
2025-02-18 01:24:17,It’s just a joke tho? (And let’s be real bitcoin is just as much of a scam as ethereum)
2025-02-18 01:30:45,😆 🤣 😂
2025-02-18 01:35:13,Tbf that answer was dumbaf I'd ban a troll too
2025-02-18 01:37:29,"Give the written agreement before the digital currency, insurance is a necessity."
2025-02-18 01:50:30,I'd quite for 3 $LIBRA
2025-02-18 01:55:42,"Those mods have also DEEPLY drunk of the trump koolaide. I posted something looking for just a lil hope that they wont shit all over bitcoin, insta-ban."
2025-02-18 02:03:45,!withdraw 1
2025-02-18 02:19:29,No..  make it 60 bitcoin
2025-02-18 02:34:21,Im convinced Luke Dashjr is one of the r/Bitcoin mod. He censors people on his twitter comments over the smallest hint of alt coin talk.
2025-02-18 02:48:16,The reaction of Reddit mods to simple and otherwise inoffensive comments baffles me
2025-02-18 02:50:07,Btc for sure.....hey id quit for 3 xrp ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|laughing)
2025-02-18 02:53:22,Reddit Mods acting like Elon.
2025-02-18 03:10:06,That sub is just a bunch of memes.  It's trash honestly.  And fuck the bitch mods.
2025-02-18 03:12:49,I’ve just done it for 0
2025-02-18 03:16:54,Classic reddit moment
2025-02-18 03:20:35,Obviously the one that replied probably that amount of money is life changing or really hates their job
2025-02-18 03:35:36,If I had 5 meow meow beenz I'd never have to work again.
2025-02-18 03:42:42,I would quit for 3 stable housings
2025-02-18 04:02:15,No but I would for 3M Toshi
2025-02-18 04:09:07,No but Id take a job thats pays me in crypto. Lets normalize crypto transactions not mass unemployment.
2025-02-18 04:11:35,WOW JUST WOW
2025-02-18 04:11:40,Sure.
2025-02-18 04:13:42,Imagine being a mod so tilted and having such an insignificant life that THIS is how you have to find purpose in life 🤦🏽‍♂️
2025-02-18 04:20:29,"soggy bottom boys, probably just sold his portfolio before the increase, as usual 😂"
2025-02-18 04:23:49,Reddit allows mods to be petty tyrants banning people on a whim. It sucks.
2025-02-18 04:23:53,"Yes, if I could immediately convert it to cash"
2025-02-18 04:47:29,Typical Reddit
2025-02-18 04:50:05,Why a mod can't be removed from sub? Some are idiots obviously
2025-02-18 04:51:50,"Fuck yeah, I would sale one instantly and put into saving and my investment portfolio and see what comes of the other two."
2025-02-18 04:56:02,Without hesitation
2025-02-18 04:57:16,Lmao I got baned on the twitter subreddit because I asked why twitter used to have 8k employees and what they did all day.
2025-02-18 05:38:24,3 Btc yes not 3 Eth
2025-02-18 05:38:51,Hyper-sensitive mod lol
2025-02-18 05:41:31,That seems a bit precious..?
2025-02-18 05:44:05,I'd quit for 3 WAXP
2025-02-18 06:01:47,One day
2025-02-18 06:03:14,"If you would quit for 3 Hawk Tuah coins, just look for a new job already"

2025-02-18 07:02:26,"These subs omg. I just read the hijacking of bitcoin and it really gives pause to how much censorship, astroturfing and grandstanding occurs specifically in the btc space."
2025-02-18 07:13:16,So much for free speech on reddit
2025-02-18 07:16:24,I was hearing about censorship in that subreddit and now it is confirmed as BTC vision to be against censorship
2025-02-18 07:20:06,That mod woke up with a taste for blood.
2025-02-18 07:42:21,Mods have too much power
2025-02-18 07:43:51,"Definitely I would do it, bearing in mind that the medium salary in my country is about $500. So I'll do it for 3 Solana"
2025-02-18 08:02:26,Bitcoin can't take a joke 🤣
2025-02-18 08:17:59,Mods are such fucking clowns.

2025-02-18 09:53:03,Lots of us are banned there.  Bunch of sweaty losers run that sub.
2025-02-18 10:02:54,That's probably not a joke answer either. 3 ETH right now is still 3-5 years salary for people from my country.
2025-02-18 10:06:50,Sure 💯
2025-02-18 10:12:35,"Yeah, then just reapply"

2025-02-18 10:54:01,😆
2025-02-18 11:17:45,"Yes, if I could do it tax free."
2025-02-18 11:31:19,"Seems like you better don’t risk other users articulating their opinion under one of your posts, as it’s apparently your responsibility to make sure all opinions are aligned (with the mods) beforehand. A lot of responsibility. Oh, and no joking around in this house!"
2025-02-18 11:45:29,Lmao this is hilarious
2025-02-18 11:57:11,"I once made a statement in the ubereats subreddit that Uber is owned by Jews * just a comment, a simple fact. Banned 💀"
2025-02-18 12:00:03,Btc subreddit mods bought in at ATH and are on edge
2025-02-18 12:01:13,"I swear most mods do it for a power trip, there's no way it's anything but that"
2025-02-18 12:18:39,"Mods and ceo, the worst parts about Reddit 1000%"
2025-02-18 12:26:15,Cringe mods but at least they told you  Got perm ban recently from r/Pokemoncards and the wimpy mods wouldn't even put a reason. Nor link a comment

2025-02-18 15:44:28,I would quit for 3 moons😜
2025-02-18 15:49:48,Buttcoin has the same ridiculous weirdo stuff going on with their moderators
2025-02-18 15:54:15,All reddit mods are severely on the spectrum.
2025-02-18 15:57:24,Welcome to Reddit
2025-02-18 15:59:32,Absolutely
2025-02-18 16:38:42,Just saying...  - Ethereum is the Blockchain. - Ether is the currency.
2025-02-18 17:10:50,>Scam coin  Broski do I got news for you.
2025-02-18 17:11:54,Pretty rich for a mod to ban somebody for something as stupid as that..... Considering what bitcoin originally was used for when it was first launched.
2025-02-18 17:16:47,I'll do that for 1
2025-02-18 17:39:22,"The BTC mob at work.  Maximum censorship, minimum divergent thought."

2025-02-18 18:25:36,"Hilariously pathetic mod, which is no surprise for Reddit in general but especially within the crypto community...   Also can we bring up how insane the original question is? Surely almost anyone would quit their job for like $280,000?? you can just take that money and find another job..."
2025-02-18 18:35:00,Ist ether
2025-02-18 19:01:03,Reddit is becoming a joke. Which other platforms are not like this?
2025-02-18 19:01:14,I'd do it for 2
2025-02-18 19:02:16,Most people should say yes
2025-02-18 19:08:33,I will quit my job and start m town business for anything. Not worth using all your life to make someone rich.
2025-02-18 19:28:58,“It’s not about the money…”
2025-02-18 20:56:58,I’d quit my jerb for 1 bitcoin. Don’t play with me!
2025-02-18 22:16:38,Yes no questions asked. I could live off that with passive income.
2025-02-18 22:26:27,"Lol, pathetic."
2025-02-18 22:56:46,"4 ETH and I'll quit and I'll go through my department and pray for everyone , then I'm taking one final dump at work and leaving."
2025-02-18 23:02:36,3 ETH would allow me to start over somewhere new. I feel him.
2025-02-18 23:58:37,Plot twist: that person’s boss saw the comment and had them banned 😂
2025-02-19 00:25:50,30 maybe
2025-02-19 01:10:03,I see no lies 
2025-02-19 03:16:37,Classic bitcoin maxi response. Btc was the first but far from the best.

2025-02-19 04:43:26,I’d quite for 3 dodge.
2025-02-19 04:57:37,That’s Reddit mods for you 😂. Always on a power trip
2025-02-19 06:35:26,A reddit mod with a God complex. How original.
2025-02-19 08:57:54,Dude fucked up and should have said .3. Btc
2025-02-19 13:33:57,kinda funny they’re labeling $eth as centralized these days.
2025-02-19 14:07:33,Reddit in a nutshell
2025-02-19 18:01:30,It was when these sort of people started popping up- the groupthink $Bitcoin worshipping cult- that I gave up on bitcoin for good.
2025-02-19 20:29:39,What job
2025-02-19 21:28:28,I would quit for 3 XCN
2025-02-20 01:05:42,I've just handed in my notice for my current job today so yes. But not for where I'm going.
2025-02-20 01:11:15,I would quit my job for 3 Tron👀!
2025-02-20 04:03:42,yes of course !
2025-02-20 05:04:36,Resistance is futile!!!!! Even if it was a joke. lol
2025-02-20 09:06:30,So everything thats not Bitcoin is a scamcoin/memecoin. Got it. Even coins that actually have utility 🤫😁
2025-02-20 15:23:08,Wow scummybags forsure
2025-02-20 16:15:54,Damn I hated doing the math but those 3 coins are more than I make in 6 years
2025-02-21 08:21:14,I would quit for one
2025-02-21 19:22:07,most probably
2025-02-21 21:12:09,I just quit my job. Can I have my 3 BTC now?
2025-02-21 21:28:54,"My job is... my life in my workshop, so... I can't quit but I accept the BTC and say that I quit... my life. But I will not go to the other side yet, I need to see the moon to the BTC. Then it will be the end :-)))))))))))"
2025-02-17 14:53:07,"I'm a BTC maxi, but the sub is run by Nazi's.   i called January 6 ""insurrectionists"" and the mod gave me the same ban."
2025-02-17 19:52:10,Let’s be real 90% of Reddit threads will ban you for the most mild comment
2025-02-17 21:47:44,"""How dare you mention your Scam coin in our scam coin echo chamber""   Seriously when will people figure out this shit is going no where."
2025-02-17 14:36:03,Sometimes you appreciate Elons Musk approach with X alot
2025-02-17 17:29:38,How much *is* one bitcoin or etherium worth? How long can I live off selling it?
2025-02-17 17:39:43,Holy shit. First time ever speechless on Reddit
2025-02-17 18:23:26,No near enough money to retire on so fuck no
2025-02-17 15:00:25,"Hell no , that’s only 300k it won’t last more than 5 years if you don’t reinvest it"
2025-02-17 16:52:58,You can get reinstated by apologizing. But r/BITCOIN is NOT fucking around.
2025-02-17 15:28:39,"Lol.  I wouldn't quit for 100 BTC. I have literally the best work I could ever have. I sit at computer coding, or browsing Reddit and get paid for it comfortably."
2025-02-17 18:22:37,"Its this sub which is lost, bitcoin maxis were always right more than a decade now unlike shitcoiner bagholders."
2025-02-17 17:16:37,"bro is being dishonest, this has been photoshopped when I ran it through my checker"
2025-02-17 17:12:48,"A lot of Reddit mods have no social awareness, which includes reading between the lines"
2025-02-18 03:04:41,"That is exactly right.  Basically: ""Would you quit your job for $300k?""  ""Heck, I'd quit for $9k.""  They weren't down on BTC at all."
2025-02-17 21:50:19,"There's no 'think' here, that's literally what it is."
2025-02-18 03:56:35,Literally this lmao. That was my first read too. God these chronically online degens  holyshit
2025-02-18 06:01:11,"This just in, 30 year old man responsible for unpaid sub-reddit monitoring doesn't understand social cues."
2025-02-17 23:14:36,"Exactly.  I laughed out loud (no- literally this time) when I read it.  This was not a knock on BTC in the slightest.  What snowflakes over there, now I'm tempted to troll them."
2025-02-18 07:32:35,"I didn't think there was any nuance there - if anything it's a slight *against* eth being worth less! It's like someone asking ""would you quit your job for a million dollars?"" And me saying I'd quit it for a 100k."
2025-02-18 10:31:32,"Ha. My reaction was ""sure"" as in ""id quit for no money"""
2025-02-19 02:44:52,I get the same feeling. wtf is up with that Mod?
2025-02-22 00:12:19,Moderator lack humor
2025-02-18 15:20:25,I would ban anyone who even mentions eth. I support the mods decision.
2025-02-17 15:08:02,That sub is one of the most insecure echo chambers you'll find on Reddit. I'm not sure there's a more censored sub.
2025-02-17 17:18:09,"Always has been. That sub is one of the biggest echo chambers on Reddit.  You have to be a special kind of idiot or completely new user to not be banned from r/bitcoin at this stage.  Try critical thinking and ask any questions that contain even genuine doubt or worry. You'll be banned quickly there.  Or better yet, notice there (rightfully and correctly) that there are cryptocurrencies out there doing something better than bitcoin! Enjoy your ban too."
2025-02-17 15:27:40,They'll ban you for anything. Other crypto subs have the most power tripping mods I've ever seen
2025-02-17 17:24:34,Dogecoin is no different. I was a dogecoin maxi last cycle since 2020. And I found a new token called dogechain I made Hella money on pre launch and managed a nft project.  I got perma banned for asking anyone if they knew about dogechain. Lol
2025-02-17 16:46:58,"Idk, it shows an insane gap in intelligence, even if shitposting.   Probably just a 12 hour cool off ban though. Gotta be more to this story…."
2025-02-17 17:25:51,IIRC it's a bot set up to automatically instant ban you and delete your comment if you mention any other crypto there 😬
2025-02-17 18:32:51,Why have 3 jobs and no money when you could have no jobs and 3 money?
2025-02-17 19:15:43,Seconded
2025-02-17 19:21:14,Rough ain’t it.
2025-02-17 19:38:21,Bitcoin maximalists aren't welcome there either. Best as i can tell it's actually the last bastion of bitcoin cash believers holding out like Japanese soldiers in the jungles of the Philippines in 1970.
2025-02-17 20:44:18,Got permabanded from a sub reddit recently for asking if a post had been deleted 20mins prior and calling out the mods for doing so because it didn't go against the subreddits policy.
2025-02-18 01:18:33,One thing to quit and another is to find a replacement because 3 BTC aint gonna last long if you dont have a job and need to pay bills and buy food.
2025-02-18 17:30:40,No. 1 Bullshit
2025-02-17 19:21:35,The irony is all crypto coins are scam coins.
2025-02-17 14:56:24,He is right tho
2025-02-17 15:53:51,"Hello,  You have been permanently banned from r/CryptoCurrency…"
2025-02-17 15:27:10,I'd quite for 3 MOON.
2025-02-17 15:17:40,"If it keeps going the way it is, you will not be alone.  I haven’t been in on Litecoin all that long, but I remember when it was in the high 80s and it bit 100, so I sold because I’m weak as piss lol"
2025-02-17 15:01:28,BANNED
2025-02-17 23:23:27,How about that hawktuahcoin?
2025-02-18 05:27:41,I'll see your 3 LTC and raise you 3 LUNC.
2025-02-17 15:41:48,Wuuu muh LTC
2025-02-17 15:55:46,"Sorry, banned."
2025-02-17 15:59:49,“Banned”
2025-02-17 17:17:19,I'd quit for 3 SHIB
2025-02-17 19:03:01,I just took a severance package worth about 1 BTC.
2025-02-17 19:03:49,3 bitcoin are worth 262 thousand dollars.  Most people would quit their job for that.
2025-02-17 20:46:52,Might just quit anyway
2025-02-17 22:29:47,You posted in the wrong subreddit bud.
2025-02-17 22:45:53,Shit man I'd just quit!
2025-02-18 00:00:39,I'd quit for 3 trump
2025-02-17 15:57:21,"Whats stupid is they weren't even implying ethereum was better or anything, it was a joke that 3 ethereum is worth a lot less but they'd still quit their job for it."
2025-02-17 18:07:06,"This 100%. I was in the Titans football subreddit, and I got permabanned for saying ""If they keep playing like this, they'll lose this game.""  They ended up losing the game..."
2025-02-17 15:44:16,You have been banned from r/loser
2025-02-17 15:13:06,Literaly 1984
2025-02-17 15:13:50,So true
2025-02-17 18:02:53,"Got banned from r/comics because I said I was glad a person didn’t get gender changing surgery, the post was saying they wanted it as a kid but realized later that they weren’t trans. I was literally agreeing with the OP."
2025-02-17 18:17:30,"I got banned from r/Music for messaging the mods about a few users in some posts being absolutely toxic for no reason and personally attacking me and others. They responded and said they knew which users I was referring to and that they’d look into, and “oh by the way, you’re muted and banned.”  I didn’t even break a fucking rule."
2025-02-17 17:12:15,Nope. That stuff will never happen at r/btc try it for yourself
2025-02-17 15:16:20,literally what i have been saying for years its sick
2025-02-17 15:48:17,"Spot on. The subreddit of my country, r/ecuador, is controlled mainly by the left. Right now, we are in election time, and they are viciously banning users, comments, and posts that go against their party, which is the party that aligns with the Venezuela of Maduro and Cuba."
2025-02-17 16:10:26,"I was banned in R Vent for venting about how reddit is full of this shit, I didn't cite any subreddits or users and I was banned under the ""no incite for brigading"" rule  that was very ironic"
2025-02-18 00:43:30,"Got perma banned from r/food and the mod said "" -from the English mod of the biggest food community on the internet"". Nice job mod, no one cares that you're the biggest food community on the internet and I'd probably never comment in the sub again anyways, nevermind look at it unless it was in the popular section. I was arguing that a sheppards pie is made with lamb and not beef, hence there aren't cow sheppards... and is called such in England, a country I'm from and have traveled to many times. Real cool and this just reminded me of it"
2025-02-17 18:13:38,"Which is why moderators are a problem, I'm fine with anti- bot bots, and blocking spam/off-topic shit. But blocking statements is wild. Yes, even hate-speech.  I'm a black American, so I've seen  as much as anyone, even from ""my own people"" my standpoint is, how are you supposed to fight hate speech if it's not out in the open, the answer isn't letting it spread in the shadows."
2025-02-17 15:52:35,My girlfriend posted a pic of her (very cute) dog in r/aww but she was permanently banned from the community because her account was “bot like”
2025-02-17 15:26:56,Politic subs must be the biggest dictatorship in the world.   Anything not 100% aligned with their view gets banned immediately.
2025-02-17 15:54:38,Pathetic losers with the tiniest bit of power they have
2025-02-17 15:25:11,"It’s an epidemic. And I feel like it’s gotten way worse in the last year or so. Reddit used to be fun. These moderators are so cringe and lame. If you go against any of their beliefs, they block you on some trumped up charges like “harassment” or what not. It’s slowly becoming just an annoying version of itself much like Twitter."
2025-02-17 16:54:26,And they believe that theyr socialist regime would totaly rocks this time!
2025-02-17 17:16:48,I've never even been banned from anything else online.  Reddit gets all their mods from club penguin
2025-02-17 17:27:55,You'll get banned from certain subreddits by commenting on other subreddits. I think if you comment on the 4chan subreddit you automatically get banned from black people Twitter.
2025-02-17 17:37:54,True.
2025-02-17 17:57:59,Can’t wait til we have to pay to be treated this way /s
2025-02-17 18:30:29,I got banned from an onion hate sub just for saying I couldn’t believe a sub for hating onions existed
2025-02-17 18:43:10,Fr😭😭😭
2025-02-17 19:00:28,Yup :)
2025-02-17 19:13:19,"i miss old reddit. when cp and doxing were the ONLY things that got deleted. if the users upvoted something, then it was recognized as what the community wanted. now, there is no community. just wanna be tyrants, and the ceos who own them."
2025-02-17 19:15:30,CFB is the fucking worst man. I got banned (temp) for simply telling a Texas fan that its sad their biggest success in recent years is a 3 loss season. Keep in mind we were both arguing in the comments lol. its not like i randomly threw shade. hell he started it
2025-02-17 20:18:10,"I will forever mention how i was perma banned for 1 comment in r/worldnews for saying ""you actually believe the human shield lies?"""
2025-02-17 20:31:08,"It's the problem with any online community that exists, eventually the no lifers get into power and take control.   As it's the only thing they have in their life, any criticism is seen as an attack on them.  As you said the whole of Reddit is like this now."
2025-02-17 20:44:32,Can confirm. Was banned from r/daddit of all places because of an asshole mod
2025-02-17 20:45:22,"This happend to me yesterday on r/LateStageCapitalism, I made 2 comments saying that I believe some of the pictures were ai and I was permanently banned and the mods reasoning was “hasbara”."
2025-02-17 21:02:53,I’m reporting you.
2025-02-17 21:03:15,True lol
2025-02-17 22:32:12,I got banned from r/unpopularopinion for not having a mainstream opinion  (that’s not the reason they gave me but it’s basically the reason)
2025-02-17 22:53:27,I got banned from one sub because I commented in a sub that was praising trump. No idea how that subreddit came across my feed. But I thought it was hilarious to be banned from a sub I’ve never commented/posted in just because I commented some cult idiot facts they were asking for. 🤣
2025-02-17 23:41:33,I have found this out a lot this new year.  Getting banned for making jokes or for posting anything against the hivemind.
2025-02-18 00:25:36,Every mod ever
2025-02-18 00:59:26,Yeah bro I got permabanned from r/suicidewatch for posting a YouTube link of something that helped me when I was in a period of darkness in a heartfelt comment sent to a dude who was struggling.    And then suspended my account immediately from contacting the mods for 30 days so I couldn’t even appeal
2025-02-17 15:22:21,Thats why i liked 9gag community much more. But lefties also entered over there and will be more and more
2025-02-17 15:23:05,"Nice generalization bud, but not even in the slightest true. The biggest reason for folks getting their comments removed are flaming or off-subreddit topics. That’s why they’re called “moderators”."
2025-02-17 16:10:30,And it’s always permanent it seems.  Just a straight “fuck off” no matter what the infraction was.  Honestly it’s for the best.. I need to stop scrolling
2025-02-17 15:37:41,lmao
2025-02-17 16:32:51,"Some Bitcoin maxis are the most pretentious people I’ve seen out there, none of them would buy in if they knew the price was guaranteed to go down in the future"
2025-02-17 17:55:59,Our currency which is owned 40% by global governments in their reserves is a decentralized curesmcy guys!!
2025-02-17 18:43:16,"""Eat shit grandma"" is something I actually see a maxi saying. Lmao"
2025-02-18 03:07:09,This is perfectly accurate and doesn’t contain an ounce of hyperbole.
2025-02-17 23:53:00,r/Superstonk be like:
2025-02-18 03:11:21,"One of the loudest BTC maxis, “Plan B” just converted all his BTC to the ETF - I’m not sure that the original principles even matter to people any more - it’s just another “number go up” asset now - might as well be the 8th addition to the mag 7 😅"
2025-02-18 01:10:06,">  I’m here to revolutionize the monetary system and unlock banking to the underrepresented, and fix a system that allows the rich to get richer while leaving normal people behind  If someone here genuinely believes that, please tell me why. As a Marxist, that sounds utterly ridiculous"
2025-02-17 17:21:04,"The move where the default ban message says you can message the mods about your ban if you have any questions, but the mod instantly bans you from messaging the moderators so you can't, is so fragile and soft I can't believe it.  But it happens a lot. IMO, that function should only exist if someone is harrassing the mods after getting banned. Sure, mute that person for a month. But to do it IMMEDIATELY after enacting the ban is shitty."
2025-02-18 09:45:16,Inb4 you're banned from this subreddit for talking bad about a mod from a different subreddit. Like I was from r/steak 😂
2025-02-18 00:12:29,"You said ""mod,"" that covers it."
2025-02-18 12:00:51,This is most mods
2025-02-17 16:08:08,Do it.
2025-02-17 16:34:10,Time to quit buddy
2025-02-17 17:57:21,I'd quit for a 3 piece chicken meal
2025-02-17 17:59:31,Now you gotta quit 14 jobs. 
2025-02-17 18:21:56,Too bad you got more than 3 Upvotes. Now you can't quit.
2025-02-17 14:48:55,I use the BTC sub to stop me getting carried away. They give BTC similar hype to shitcoins elsewhere and it keeps me grounded.
2025-02-17 15:09:25,I went there to ask about btc fundamentals and they picked through my account history and berated me for holding eth and didn’t bother answering my questions.
2025-02-17 15:04:28,there is a btc sub and a bitcoin sub and they are very different
2025-02-17 14:38:54,"nothing holds a candle to XRP subreddit. you can speedrun any% wr attempts, and it's always a one way ticket with no\* chance for appeal."
2025-02-17 15:03:45,For real. Those morons holding onto their Bitcoin Cash in r/btc crying about the white paper. r/Bitcoin on the other hand... I'm sympathetic. I don't agree with the censorship but I'm also not a moderator there. Can you imagine all the meme coin shillers trying to post there?
2025-02-17 18:12:18,If only it was 9K 😭  We rekt
2025-02-17 22:24:26,"I got a hard ban from r/Europe for the most mundane thing. 9 months now, no answers to appeals, just blanket muting. Most infuriating thing that's ever happened to me in 15 years on this site."
2025-02-17 21:55:52,">I’ve been banned in more subreddits I can count just for saying counter ideas/opinions.   Yeah it's mad, and sad."
2025-02-17 15:23:44,Those RCA of yours must not be selling too well.

2025-02-17 15:27:54,I would do some morally questionable things for 3 BTC or a MOON pump to $1... /s
2025-02-17 16:38:37,"Coming back to this very fact, they immediately mute you so you can’t try to reason with them is so bizarre. There’s not one person on earth with a lot of bitcoin that acts like that."
2025-02-17 14:49:44,It’s even worse if you participate in political subs as a non-trumper.    I have bots  that follow me around making inflammatory statements in the hopes I reply and get banned.
2025-02-17 14:51:22,"Because you are concerned they might not read the message, start another account, and post about Ethereum in r/bitcoin? It's not ideal but you need to be able to combat bots somehow. (And yes, OP is not a bot.)"
2025-02-17 16:10:19,Even religions are usually more open minded than that subreddit
2025-02-17 21:22:36,More of a cult
2025-02-17 19:02:34,Consider the kind of person who wants to spend their free time moderating communication on an online forum for no pay or recognition. Either they really love helping the community or they really love controlling the discourse. You can guess which ones make waves.
2025-02-18 07:04:48,Pure insecurity
2025-02-17 22:15:46,I’m blind and could see the humor in your post.
2025-02-18 13:29:51,"I guess the only acceptable way of making that joke would've been ""I would quit for 3 sats""... ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  Or maybe everyone was supposed to comment ""bruh, I'm a gigachad and gigachads don't quit"" or some similar bs. You know, the company line."

2025-02-17 19:17:18,"> ...believe it or not, yes... I don't HATE my job. but that's actually a lot for me and I can look for employment elsewhere.  that was my take as well. i love it where i am, but that's roughly $300k.  putting that into something with a 3% dividend rate is $9k/year. for that kind of net worth increase / passive income hike, i can send out a few resumes and accept that buyout offer."
2025-02-17 19:14:01,"reddit does that a lot, secretly making posts/people disappear."
2025-02-17 19:08:51,> some pathetic people out there man.  it's unfortunate that so many gravitate towards positions of power.
2025-02-17 19:17:20,And it was quite funny to be honest.

I promise I won't do it again."" they might consider doing this.               I did something in /r/xrp or /r/ripple years ago. Got banned without reason, then checked my post history and realized I asked a question about ethereum in one of those subs. DM'd the mods, told them I read the rules, apologized, then they unbanned me."
2025-02-17 20:53:42,Not cool :(

2025-02-17 14:43:12,The approach of him banning random words and people who oppose him?  The only difference I see is the scale.
2025-02-17 14:46:15,spending 40+ billion dollars to help his favorite felon  *I appreciated that*
2025-02-18 02:21:34,They definitely allow posts and comments that's puts altcoins in a bad light.
2025-02-17 19:20:43,"> How much is one bitcoin or etherium worth?  one bitcoin is roughly $100k (USD), and an eth is roughly $2700.  (so for 3, it would be roughly $300k or roughly $8k)"
2025-02-17 19:12:02,"> No near enough money to retire on so fuck no  it's one hell of a jump start to go find work someplace else. for a lot of people that's going to be 3-5 years of salary. getting that up front so it can grow is huge, and then in a few months you find someplace new so the vast majority of that is pure profit."
2025-02-17 15:07:07,You can always get a new job
2025-02-17 15:38:22,300k$ is insane amount of money for majority of the world
2025-02-17 17:04:59,Blocking users *just because* is the definition of fucking around.

2025-02-18 06:07:41,Or can't take a joke/everything is an attack on them personally
2025-02-18 12:26:52,Polite way for saying virgins
2025-02-18 03:11:06,Most Reddit Mods cant read which is why they manage to be mods in the first place. Its unfortunate because ive found myself exiled from some really great communities because mods go snooping into your posts.     Can't be part of a political subreddit because you like video games. As an example. This place is hell.
2025-02-18 10:13:18,A lot of Reddit mods also don’t have jobs so they don’t know what the struggle is.
2025-02-18 01:32:06,"You have to be a little autistic, with fairly severe justice sensitivity, to even want to spend your free time as a mod.  Just obsessed with rules, can't pick up on sarcasm, and don't appreciate levity."
2025-02-18 01:19:35,Kkjjjjjj so accurate bro
2025-02-18 10:34:31,[reminds me of this](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2F2nz5fcpz2lzd1.jpeg%3Fwidth%3D677%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D7379ccd0c8b4c2a9e900458bdc999027b8428230)
2025-02-18 19:45:00,Unfortunately the personal qualities which make a person want to be a mod are often the ones which make a person unsuitable for the task.
2025-02-18 21:43:52,The tism strikes again
2025-02-19 01:07:35,Power tripping
2025-02-18 07:01:46,People that support bitcoin with their entire identies do not have the mental capacity to possibly grasp most of what people say.
2025-02-18 05:29:21,That’s all of Reddit
2025-02-18 06:05:46,"I mean if this is your [average Reddit mod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yUMIFYBMnc), then yeah, of course."
2025-02-18 09:10:13,R/gym is the worstttttt
2025-02-18 10:18:30,Hard to read between lines when there is only one.
2025-02-18 15:37:42,They do it for free.
2025-02-19 02:44:12,"My guess is a bot looks for any mention of an alt coin, because historically conversations that include them devolve into rubbish, and there have been so many of them it’s too hard to police so there’s an auto ban, so that comment just got picked up by a bot with no subtlety."
2025-02-19 07:32:42,"I doubt most mods even go outside, the only people that have time to mod are people with no life outside their PC."
2025-02-19 13:37:44,"Lot of Karens for sure, tripping off their “power”"
2025-02-19 20:19:26,"Mods there just Cntrl F search ""ETH"" and ban."
2025-02-24 23:42:54,No the way and the reasoning they give is trash 
2025-02-24 23:43:02,No the way and the reasoning they give is trash 
2025-02-18 15:20:46,Doesn't matter. And stop thinking in terms of fiat.
2025-02-18 15:21:15,Not the point at all.
2025-02-17 15:10:21,Have you seen r/conservative
2025-02-17 15:21:47,That’s that bag holder hate mentality. They never were taught how to lose so they get this grudge they carry on to every other aspect of their life. Never accepting responsibility for their own mistakes they transfer that blame and do stupid shit like this cause it’s a blow to their pride.   Either that or mod is just a dick and enjoys banning people.
2025-02-17 15:19:07,r/conservative or r/debatereligion?
2025-02-17 15:25:33,I'd like to introduce you to r/ShitPoliticsSays
2025-02-17 17:30:40,R/Conservative is the most wretched hive of scum on the Internet
2025-02-17 16:13:21,You should /r/AskHistorians about that.
2025-02-17 16:25:22,Have you seen r/xrp ?
2025-02-17 16:43:13,You must not visit much of Reddit then.  Lots of censored subs.
2025-02-17 17:03:52,That's reddit...wtf you talking about.
2025-02-17 17:15:13,A bit off topic but I think I found one that gives it a run for its money. r/inflation won’t allow you to comment if your comment contains the words “bird flu” on posts about egg prices.
2025-02-17 17:31:06,I got banned from r/pics because I have a link to my Etsy store in my Reddit profile.  Had nothing to do with my comment on the post but simply for being there I was permanently banned.
2025-02-17 17:36:17,r/petfree
2025-02-17 17:53:08,r/pics is pretty bad too for some reason
2025-02-17 17:56:48,Have you seen r/europe ?
2025-02-17 18:07:38,Pretty much any political sub is extremely policed.
2025-02-17 18:09:43,ever see r/pics
2025-02-17 18:21:13,I can’t even comment on here! It would remove my comments for being “too new”
2025-02-17 18:27:28,wait till you post on /news or /worldnews :)
2025-02-17 18:30:25,try going against their favorite politician in r/Brasil
2025-02-17 18:41:57,90% of subs have turned into echo chambers who accuse other subs/websites of echo chambers.
2025-02-17 18:42:40,"r/darkjokes , but that's for trolling purposes I presume."
2025-02-17 18:48:09,All of reddit.
2025-02-17 18:55:11,"Not surprising when you see how many Bitcoin grifters and scam accounts there is out there. BTC came from good origins, but money has corrupted all."
2025-02-17 19:03:06,Wait till you go on r/propagandaposters some many Neo-communists
2025-02-17 19:09:17,"Try r/Chicago, bunch of socialists hanging there."
2025-02-17 19:10:38,Pretty much all the “news” subs are like this too regardless of how you vote. Objectivity is often unwelcome on this platform.
2025-02-17 19:10:48,Have you ever visited a flat earth sub run by a flat earther? There’s a few of them and it’s basically just a few people posting crazy stuff and banning literally anyone who questions them.
2025-02-17 19:14:55,The Tesla ones that I got preemptively banned from (r/elonmusk and r/Cybertruck are a couple of them) because I made a comment in a sub the Tesla mods don’t like. I never even viewed a post on their subs before they banned me and my comment wasn’t really even criticism.
2025-02-17 19:39:46,r/gamingcirclejerk would like a word 😭
2025-02-17 19:50:41,HAVE YOU SEEN r/Texas ???? The mods are absolutely diabolical over there. Their egos are out the wazoo
2025-02-17 19:51:56,I absolutely hate that sub. There’s some old man obsessed with Sailor Moon that will hunt down anyone saying anything as controversial as “it might be good to diversify instead of having your entire life savings in BTC”
2025-02-17 19:53:09,"r/AnalogCommunity and r/analog are pretty insecure. They pretty much remove comments on every post now, thats why we have r/AnalogCircleJerk"
2025-02-17 19:59:25,"Have you been on Reddit I have been banned in almost every sub except Golf simulator…. Most betting, coin, stink, and political sites though gone! This is Reddit… where freedom of speech is oh not really a thing! ♾️🏴‍☠️🤙"

2025-02-17 20:38:14,/r/Islam
2025-02-17 20:50:44,You just described Reddit as a whole lol…
2025-02-17 20:53:40,"/r/news is up there  They banned me for 'breaking the rules', so I messaged them asking what rule I broke. They just muted me for 7 days. I waited out the mute and asked again stating that I went over the rules and I didn't violate any of them; they muted me for 7 days *again* and then reported me to reddit for harassment. I got a **3 day ban** for harassment, which I appealed stating that I was only asking what rule I broke and that they never even replied much less telling me to stop messaging and the ban was lifted.  I waited out the 7 days, and asked *once again* which rule I broke, which led to *another* 7 day mute and *another* 3 day ban from reddit for 'harassment'. I appealed this one the same way I appealed the previous one, and was denied.  I never broke any of their rules, and they never once replied to my message in any way other than just muting me for 7 days; didn't even say 'you're banned stop asking'. Bunch of power hungry, stereotypical 'reddit mods' that just get rid of anything that doesn't go along with what they believe."
2025-02-17 20:59:51,90% of reddit is like that. Lol
2025-02-17 21:01:35,"have you seen r/nvidia been on lockdown since their failure of a new video card launch?  can't post anything there, get's auto deleted."
2025-02-17 21:54:42,All Tesla and Elon Musk subs are in the running.
2025-02-17 22:04:01,"Any of the commie subs. You'll get banned just for being a different flavour of commie, which keeps with the theme I suppose"
2025-02-17 22:18:40,r/XRP is the worst. I got banned for posting a quote an exec at Ripple said.  It's the worst echo chamber and they all think XRP is going to $1000.
2025-02-17 22:21:01,r/Europe is surprisingly brutal
2025-02-17 23:06:59,"It mirrors a work chan I'm part of, there's no actual facts, it's just speculation and metric shit-tonnes of Copium"
2025-02-18 00:07:59,r/SnyderCut  One of the rules is not being able to criticize Snyder or his work
2025-02-18 00:16:51,Drama subs are pretty bad rn
2025-02-18 01:34:34,"/r/worldnews, /r/neoliberal, /r/atheism, /r/news..."
2025-02-18 02:26:29,"Yeah I got banned for a week, then again for 30 days."
2025-02-18 03:59:42,I got banned from white people twitter for asking a question
2025-02-18 04:06:31, r/pics would like a word.
2025-02-18 04:47:35,"It's been taken over by right wing lunatics. Or as we call them to their faces, nazis."
2025-02-18 05:46:27,You sure ? I've been banned off 5 or 6 for some pretty shit told a guy on personal finance he would be stupid to get married.   Bam !!! Banned
2025-02-18 06:03:54,"I can assure you 99% of the posters there are dirt poor and have zero concept of personal finance. They constantly shit on USD shitcoin showing it go to 0 over 100 years but haven't even watched 5 much less 10 year returns of the S&P500.  Don't get me wrong. I hold some Bitcoin. I know its potential, but if you can't even budget to figure out basic savings, going Bitcoin crazy isn't going to help you."
2025-02-18 08:02:48,Buttcoin or AskEconomics ban very fast if you don’t post or comment on a way that agrees with their narrative
2025-02-17 15:58:40,"I just posted something on it, Ima see how fast I get banned lmao"
2025-02-17 15:19:31,There is. It’s called r/de and they ban everything that isn’t left.
2025-02-17 16:50:20,"Post any conservative opinion outside r/conservative, it’s all censored "
2025-02-17 21:28:59,"Long time r/bitcoin user and im not banned, just say shitcoin when you talk about anything else than btc."
2025-02-18 02:07:36,I’m banned from there too. It’s just sucking each other off about how Bitcoin will go to five million and market cap doesn’t matter because YOLO
2025-02-18 04:23:18,"What's doing better than Bitcoin? As far as I know, it has the highest price per coin in the market"
2025-02-21 07:09:03,im new here why are there so many crypto subs and which is better for discussing
2025-02-17 20:54:50,"I dunno man, Buttcoin sub is worse imo!!"
2025-02-17 18:33:04,Because they don't allow speaking about any altcoins as policy. Although I must say that its usually ok in the comments.
2025-02-17 21:14:53,"I got a 30day ban for criticizing the mods in comments to other users. Not even a post, just in the comments of a relevant discussion."
2025-02-18 08:15:40,"It could if you move to a cheap country, cut down on costs, and just live off the least you can.  If you wanna be fancy and have a house and drive a car and support a family, maybe wait a few more years."
2025-02-17 19:30:02,All crypto is a scam. Except bitcoin. Bitcoin is the only money on the planet that isn't a scam. That and maybe gold a little too. But mostly bitcoin is just better money than gold in every way imaginable.
2025-02-17 14:59:12,He is objectively and demonstrably false.
2025-02-17 15:53:34,The bullshit part is that the guy was making a joke in the style of “Would you quit your job for a million bucks?” “Hell I’d do it for 10.000”. And got banned for that.
2025-02-17 16:29:52,One thing good about r/cc is that we don’t mindlessly ban people for stating opinions unlike every crypto coin subreddit out there
2025-02-17 17:04:25,Ssh no moons
2025-02-17 22:20:15,I'd get banned from /r/CryptoCurrency for 3 ALGO.
2025-02-17 15:43:26,"Whats the ""walecoins"" in your flair?"
2025-02-17 16:22:13,I'd quit for 3 UST

2025-02-17 16:30:43,"It’s actually even poking fun at Eth because he is joking that he would quit his job for peanuts, but of course the insecure losers at the sub couldn’t handle that"
2025-02-17 18:56:59,So its your fault then.
2025-02-18 02:09:53,Sounds like your fault. Do you not realize how dangerous opinions are? Next you’ll have people thinking for themselves can’t have that now.
2025-02-17 19:00:10,Drake thanks you dearly
2025-02-17 16:07:04,Holy hell
2025-02-17 17:02:49,LITERALLY OMG like big brother watching me through reddit right guys LITERALLY

2025-02-17 20:02:22,"Comics is now a political sub too.  ¯\\_ (ツ)_/¯   Got my ban about a month ago.  Picked up a publicfreakout one this weekend and just had to laugh because I didn't agree with protesters mad that ""the evil far right"" were going to be made look good by terror attacks."
2025-02-17 16:42:28,"Really haha? conservatives are doing the same here, but not on social media. Just inside our government nothing else"

2025-02-18 00:50:38,"As a mod elsewhere, I should note that there is a new harassment filter that interprets comments and removes them if it considers them harassment. Subreddits can adjust its settings, but it was automatically turned on at some point recently. It's actually been pretty accurate, but by that I mean about 75% accurate. Luckily I get to review everything it filters."

2025-02-17 19:56:48,"And things they don't agree with. You legit could say the sky is blue and they'll say not it's not, where I live it's black. There's no excuse for these losers who thrive off of power on the internet."

2025-02-17 19:17:04,"I once had a 3 month long convo with a moderator about a ban. It was only three messages though because they muted me for 30 days each time, lol. Their conflict resolution style reminded me of high school."
2025-02-17 21:05:56,"I got an account banned because I was harassing the moderators of r/assassinscreed \- they banned me for spoiling (at the time) 2 year old spoilers for the show ""The Last Kingdom"" I'd remind them every time I was unbanned how stupid that was until a reddit admin took me out."
2025-02-18 09:35:11,Happened to me in a popular UK sub. Merely mentioned my son was autistic and they banned me without the chance to defend myself because apparently I was being cruel.   My son is autistic. Diagnosed.   They just cut me off and wouldn't entertain an appeal. Even Reddit didn't help.
2025-02-18 14:50:06,"lol not all subs are cesspits haha.  So far seems to be good mods here, unlike a steak sub of all places hahaha"
2025-02-17 18:00:39,42 now - maybe bro retired
2025-02-17 16:33:58,A lot of Bitcoiners are really just shitcoiners who invested into one coin called BTC and then they thought they are above the rest
2025-02-17 17:09:47,"Have they stopped vying with buttcoin to be the most anti-bitcoin sub yet?  Last I checked every mod was a bitcoindotcom employee, and Ver was still on a bcash crusade (obviously has bigger issues at the moment I guess).  Any post even remotely positive about bitcoin was downvoted to hell, the mods even stalked you around reddit, was fun times posting in there!"
2025-02-17 21:24:48,"Oh, so the neurotic read through of account history is standard. I was so confused when they were quoting something I said 3 months prior... which ALSO wasn't a violation of sub rules but apparently offended them anyways.  I was like... did they literally read through all my r bitcoin comments? That's wilds, it was my main sub, they must have spent a solid 15 minutes skimming just to find that, only to then ban me for a non-violation."
2025-02-17 14:51:40,"I am an xrp holder, and I have to agree.  One of the worst subs I’ve even engaged. So many misinformed people. Asking the same misinformed questions."

2025-02-17 15:36:00,I got banned for shitposting a price prediction lol
2025-02-18 02:14:05,I don’t get the appeal of XRP but so many of them just blindly scream about it going to 100 or more I’m like Market Caps do exist.
2025-02-17 22:40:10,"Doesn’t surprise me, it looks like times are changing a bit because their online narratives don’t match the real world at all.  How did Trump get elected?

Too much crazy shit and now we have a total nut job getting elected when alls people had to do was be chill."
2025-02-17 15:25:18,"Yeah, I will need your help. I use that money to buy noodles /s"
2025-02-17 16:30:49,Correct
2025-02-17 14:54:56,"I’m not gonna do that. I don’t know if this is for me, but I’m not gonna do any of that. I was just making a quip about the one thing I don’t like about mod power."

2025-02-17 19:17:07,strength in numbers
2025-02-17 14:46:48,The absence of moderation I think they mean.
2025-02-17 19:47:28,"Ok.  So I can comfortably say yes, if i could immediately sell it then yeah I'd quit my job, pay off my rent and credit card debt (i don't have a ton but still), and go ahead and find a job i actually like."
2025-02-17 20:14:57,"Still not enough to quit my job. I’m making just over 6 figures a year so, basically a little less than 3 years of my annual income is definitely not worth quitting my job. But it is a very nice boost to add to the already well funded nest egg."
2025-02-17 15:10:01,Yeah but speaking from experience I’ve seen people quit their jobs from inheritance and watched the fortune get pissed away quickly. You’re definitely not set for like with 300k

2025-02-18 02:11:15,I thought it might be a little higher on Reddit but unfortunately not looking like it.
2025-02-18 02:56:20,I just saw that post
2025-02-18 06:42:46,"Reddit mods do home schooling, they haven't reached that level yet..."

2025-02-18 11:00:15,My point exactly
2025-02-18 15:41:53,"You HAVE to think in terms of fiat.  Your job pays you in fiat.  Your groceries require fiat to pay for them.  Realistically, no one accepts crypto payments.  At least, no one that sells major life items like groceries, mortgage, car payments, etc.  You might find a business here and there that accepts crypto, but it is far from the norm.  If you only think in terms of crypto, you will be incompatible with most of the world.  That might change in the future, but today fiat is still in control."
2025-02-17 17:11:48,/r/dogecoin is bad too. Really sad because it was a fun community in the mid 2010s.
2025-02-17 15:47:42,Probably the same people. I got banned because I disagreed that you need to own a gun to be a man.
2025-02-17 16:46:35,"Let's not pretend damn near every political sub on this site, left or right, isn't an echo chamber"
2025-02-17 17:59:06,Or any flatearth sub other than the actual r/flatearth which isn't FOR them but usually mocking it
2025-02-17 18:24:50,Lord that was a scary place
2025-02-18 00:15:34,It's like an alternate universe over there
2025-02-17 19:04:42,Have you seen r/politics 
2025-02-17 17:15:17,I got banned from there for saying that millions of people starving to death is not compatible with the teachings of Christ....I guess they did not want to read the Bible passages or tons of data I linked them lol.
2025-02-17 17:27:00,Hold my beer …
2025-02-17 17:31:07,Don’t act like every main sub isn’t absolutely censored echo chamber lmao. I’m banned from most every one.
2025-02-17 17:54:09,r/elonmusk Is more censored than r/conservative. 95% of comments are deleted. It's a graveyard except for the one or two bootlickers. It's insane.
2025-02-17 18:16:31,i saw someone ask in good faith if trump really did unban ticktock and they got unpersoned.
2025-02-17 18:38:54,Fair point.
2025-02-17 18:51:25,The mods on r/pics are actual demons.
2025-02-17 19:01:38,How about r/gamingcirclejerk lol
2025-02-17 19:12:59,Have you seen r/50501
2025-02-17 19:18:51,"Ironic, thats the only sub you can talk about supporting anything right leaning without getting banned lmfao"
2025-02-17 19:41:47,I dont think half of the users there are even real americans.  The mods also shadow ban people from the looks of things.
2025-02-17 19:51:38,Have you seen r/circlejerkgaming
2025-02-17 20:42:42,"Or worldnews, where Palestine should be referred to as American condo development zone 3"

2025-02-18 02:28:51,On there talking shit now hahah
2025-02-18 03:04:36,Fuck everyone in there
2025-02-18 03:19:21,r/elonmusk  Two million users. Hundreds of comments on posts. You can read two or three of them if the mod u/twinbee doesn't get their feelings hurt by them.
2025-02-18 05:10:18,Have you seen r/elonmusk
2025-02-18 05:21:44,Can't got banned

2025-02-18 13:17:10,"Why did i read ""r/censorvative"" i clicked only because i thought that might be a fun satire...  I was disappointed.."
2025-02-17 16:55:12,They need their safe space else the cognitive dissonance could be fatal.
2025-02-17 16:01:58,"You’re joking right?  99% of Reddit is liberal.  We say one thing that even sounds like I’m conservative, we get banned.  That’s if we even say something at all, because we just lurk or we get banned.  Ya’ll are literally taking amongst yourselves saying the same shit over and over again with no one to debate 🤣"
2025-02-17 16:42:02,"Why did I click that link, my day is ruined now"
2025-02-17 22:48:30,I clicked out of curiosity.  I now feel a bit sick to my stomach.
2025-02-17 19:14:45,"Nah r/Conservative is conservative but not exclusionary.  It literally hosts left versus right debate posts periodically. It also lets left-wingers comment so much that you can find conservatives getting straight up brigaded. That’s not an ‘insecure’ place.   r/liberals is a freaking private sub (!) and r/politics, r/liberal, and r/democrats act like r/ bitcoin did in the post. Banhappy echo chambers."
2025-02-17 18:05:23,I can beat you: r/elonmusk
2025-02-17 18:27:05,Bro have you seen r/politics or r/worldnews or literally any of the other hundred or so leftist political subs?
2025-02-17 16:47:14,Have you seen /news?
2025-02-17 17:09:24,No I haven’t. I’d imagine it’s the opposite opinion of 80% of the subs having nothing to do with politics. Considering the r/conservative link in the crypto currency subreddit
2025-02-18 00:02:17,Are you new here?
2025-02-17 15:25:22,Hard agree on those but the same goes for the other side subreddits too…
2025-02-17 15:24:21,"Agreed, those are crazy subs filled with echo-chamber points of view. I visit conservative occasionally to see if it has improved, but man it's sad how some talking points are clear propaganda."
2025-02-17 15:25:35,I don't blame r/conservative for the censors because the whole majority of Reddit is controlled by Liberals so it's pretty much necessary for them to do that.
2025-02-17 15:59:48,I got banned from /r/LateStageCapitalism for pointing out the post was Chinese propaganda.
2025-02-17 16:10:14,"For the sake of my mental health, I’m not even gonna peek at the second one"

2025-02-17 15:22:33,nice bait you got there
2025-02-17 16:57:27,Bitcoin will ban you if you even comment in some other subreddits.
2025-02-17 17:54:56,Being downvoted =/= being censored.
2025-02-17 18:08:58,r conservative is the most beautiful fusion of snowflakes and russian bots i’ve ever seen
2025-02-17 23:38:47,"You didn't have to admit that but uhhhh respect for owning it, I guess"
2025-02-18 06:45:10,"Yeah, if you take market cap as a measurement of doing good then nothing is better.  However, market cap isn't good measurement of technical capability. There are things bitcoin can't do while other crypto can. So that should you give you a clue."
2025-02-17 21:06:10,">I dunno man, Buttcoin sub is worse imo!!   In buttcoin sub you can share whatever you think. You can even praise bitcoin. You'll be laughed at and probably someone will explain the stupidity of your comment, if there will be any in it, but you'll not get banned for having different opinion.  You'll have to outright call moderators per idiots to get banned in buttcoin.  So, in summary, I do not agree with you and I do not think that buttcoin sub is worse when it comes to censorship. Far from it."
2025-02-17 20:22:44,Great satire 10/10
2025-02-17 15:03:07,"By what metric, it is pre mined now?"
2025-02-17 23:25:04,"It's almost like people know that hype is baked into the price, so anything that discourages hype may cost them money."
2025-02-18 00:27:07,"That’s not true. I mentioned one crypto one time and it got me banned for a year last cycle. I’m not gonna say the crypto because of the fear of the ban again. They already have removed my ability to earn crypto, in this sub, forever."

2025-02-17 15:58:19,What’s funny is that’s straight up blatantly untrue and can be verified in about 8 seconds of actual work - but the conservative sub does actually only allow verified conservative members to comment or interact with posts.  I’d accept this as a learning moment and do better next time.
2025-02-17 15:51:39,"I'm white, don't hide the fact and post there all the time and get 1000s of up votes. Why lie?"

2025-02-17 23:21:08,"I got banned from the Buttcoin sub for having a debate with someone, instant ban no warning nothing.   I did not swear I did not insult anyone, I'm always polite online in the majority of my interactions.   They gave some bullshit reason.

2025-02-17 18:15:16,I went to check the validity of that statement in their comment history and just in the last year they’ve given several different reasons for why they got banned. They have hundreds of comments bashing conservatives. Pretty sure this one is a lie. Which makes sense because it sure sounds like one

Simply put, he confused the laws of logic (which were created to describe nature) with the reality that logic explains. Simple reification fallacy. Guy was bragging about being a logician and he was confusing the map for the territory.

Do they demand you go to their discord to have an ""actual"" discussion that consists of mobbing and mocking dissident thoughts until you leave or get kicked?  r/Conservative is on a whole different level of being a biased echochamber, and it's disingenuous to claim it's ""just the same"" as the others. That claim is what they tell themselves to justify their censorship and paranoia, it's the classic ""accuse them of what we do"". It's also extremely telling that they are incapable of promoting and supporting their ideology on its own merits in an open forum."

However, let's all pretend to be adults for two seconds and look at what is happening. In the US, we have had bills introduced by MAGA Republicans outlawing gay marriage, abortion on the federal level, and discrimination protections. So, I can imagine that a lot of gay people, women, and people with disabilities are going to have a hard time being nice to a group that stripped their fundamental rights as human beings away......"

2025-02-17 16:34:03,"Wrong. They have censors because they promote factually incorrect information and disingenuous interpretations/arguments to factual information (similar to your comment) that perpetuates propaganda and keeps easily tricked people (who think that doing sufficient independent research means consuming “news” from the same echo chamber that produces and promotes the misinformation and disinformation in the first place) in servile fearfulness. The “hostile behavior of Reddit Liberals” is usually just some person pointing that out. People are not hostile because they disagree. MAGA supporters have been trained to deflect any counter-argument by dismissing it as “liberally biased” and do not see the irony in it. You’ll probably think I’m being hostile here, ironically not recognizing the logical fallacy in your comment."

2025-02-17 16:58:16,There was a time when you could have a reasonable discussion on r/conservative. Then the crazies took over and anything that even hinted at being critical of Trump earned a ban. Trumpees can’t stand any critical discussion and need a safe space to make fun of safe spaces.

I know you’re just going to downvote this, but I couldn’t resist replying. The Democratic Party is run by centrist anti-labor shills.

It’s hard to argue about policies when every issue gets turned into “they’re eating the cats” or “they’re spending your tax dollars on criminal transgender surgery”"
2025-02-17 20:51:52,"> The left, notably fixated on   (Then he uses a word used by the right wing for identity politics)"
2025-02-17 18:24:57,"A couple things: * Kamala and the dems barely said a thing about identity politics the entire election cycle. Race, gender, and ethnicity influenced the Republican side a lot more. * Those overseas programs weren’t fucking charity. They exist to sure up our National security interests abroad. If Elon’s proposed cuts to USAID go through, we’d cede the tiny foothold we had abroad to China. * the primary thing is 100% valid. Biden should’ve never run for a second term. Him doing so likely helped cost the dems the Election. * she would still be better than the disaster Trump is currently running, firing everyone that oversees the nuclear stockpile and then begging them to come back once they realized how stupid that was. * Kamala ended her campaign in debt because she has a tragic habit of actually paying her bills and spending all the money she was donated. Meanwhile, ever the savvy businessman, Trump stiffs any bill he can. Which is why many large venues refuse to hold his events these days. * meanwhile, Trump ran up the highest bill of any president in history (more than Biden… narrowly), since it turns out the country can’t just stiff its bills, although Trump and Elon certainly are trying lol."
2025-02-17 18:54:39,I hope bad things happen to you every day forever
2025-02-19 01:54:44,">I got banned from there all just for saying most pollsters had Trump winning before election day.  Uh huh, sure.  This reminds me of when conservatives will bitch and moan about getting banned or canceled for their ""conservative views"" and when you ask them what views specifically it's always some reprehensible hateful thing."
2025-02-17 17:16:40,Tell me more about how I'm not running around crying fraud and committing an insurrection because I'm mad my party lost ;)
2025-02-17 16:12:04,"Look man, I'm generally a 3rd party voter. We have a president that is fucking shilling scam coins... I'm going to bitch at the folks who voted for this sleezeball all I want."
2025-02-17 19:34:45,🤣 sounds good. Consider me “pissed”

2025-02-19 08:23:36,"Contradiction (sexism, racism, classism) is a contraindication of intelligence. It’s a well known fact that a principle of conservatism is less government oversight (which stems from taxation) “if you criticize conservatives all you care about is money” (which conservatives are trying to keep in your pocket and out of uncle Sam’s) I’m not saying it’s all they care about but money staying with the earner is a big part of being red. Why do you think industries and the wealthy majority tend to lean that way?"
2025-02-18 15:15:00,"Again, I'm asking for your opinion on the matter, so are you going to give me your answer or are you just going to keep deflecting?  You see, it's easy to go along with the mindless Reddit hivemind to farm dopamine through confirmation bias in what is essentially a left leaning echo chamber, but it requires a little brain power when someone asks you to state your reasoning for making such statements. You probably weren't expecting anyone on Reddit in your echochamber to question you on it, were you? So now that you don't have a good answer, you're trying to turn it around on me to get me to answer the question for you, which takes the pressure off yourself. It's the redditor way."

It’s possible to be open minded and share interest from both sides. Not everything has to be one or the other"
2025-02-17 18:48:45,lol the typical “no you” that the left always uses when shit didn’t work out. Keep crying in your echo chambers after missing on an open net  lmfao
2025-02-17 20:11:09,Ok lol where did I say I voted for him. Keep reaching bot
2025-02-18 10:40:32,> the DNC is not at all focused on wokeness. lmao. i mean really;  ahh yes it was the Republicans who were championing 'LatinX' huh? Wasnt the Dems at all
2025-02-17 18:31:30,"What’s it feel like to run such a terrible 4 years that most the country just completely flips and starts going against said agenda, step out of the echo chamber that is Reddit and go interact with actual humans rather than bots and paid shills"
2025-02-17 20:56:15,"Yea true… they could’ve been like “ok morons, no.” Then go on to talk about stuff that actually matters"

2025-02-19 09:25:51,"That first sentence makes absolutely no sense.  Using lots of long words to appear intelligent is a “contraindication of intelligence”.  You sound like you’ve learned English from one of those “Word of the Day” desk calendars.  As for rhe rest of the word salad -   1. Have you ever heard of paragraphs, or even line breaks 2. Conservatives used to have values such as less government oversight because they thought it would help their electors.  Trump is destroying agencies that are trying to investigate his wrongdoings.  He’s 100% out for himself 3.  Conservatives have consistently voted to reduce tax for higher earners but not for lower income people.  If you earn less than 100K you will be worse off than you were last year.  They have consistently voted to reduce tax on corporations.  That’s why the rich and corporations tend to be conservative"

2025-02-17 18:51:50,"It’s not a no you, this is the actual stance taken by my Republican grandmother and uncle since about 2010.   They watched Fox more and more. Started talking about how Mexicans were murdering animals in the woods and that’s why they didn’t see as many turkeys each year, stopped doing hobbies with their friends outside of going to church, and every Christmas would unprompted bring up random conservative talking points like “wokeness”, which by the way, has never once been vocalized into what “wokeness” actually means apart from “everything I don’t like is wokeness”.   Genuinely this is what every Republican is."

2025-02-19 09:34:56,"Sorry you didn’t understand but it all made sense, it’s a forum not a dissertation my punctuation is irrelevant. Yeah it does in simple terms, you contradicted yourself and made yourself look how you do. Contra - opposite indication - information that leads to a conclusion. You showed us you lack intelligence. To your 2nd (formerly third) point so he’s eliminating government oversight?! Just bc it’s not in a way you agree with doesn’t make any less of what it is.. but conservatives of old loved taxes according to you?? 3. You don’t have to explain to me what I was telling you, about the military industrial complex, but it seems you already knew that. So what was your point with the other person? I wont explain the -isms bc they are blatant. Reading comprehension like your political knowledge, poor/abysmal."

2025-02-17 20:10:25,I have a chicken coop and a garden big enough to feed my family and friends… but they’re no more expensive than when Biden was in office… are yall just now seeing the inflation most the country was complaining about since covid? How convenient lmfao
2025-02-18 01:44:31,That’s your opinion. And it means nothing
2025-02-17 20:59:07,So now calling something out is actively engaging/ participating in it?? lol what ever makes you happy. I’ll remember to not call the cops next time I see a crime because  that would imply I was engaged in it… better go after all the people who call out and stand against child predators or human trafficking since they’re engaged in it just for mentioning it
2025-02-18 00:03:46,As if that means anything coming from someone who lives in a Reddit echo chamber

2025-02-18 01:47:37,inflation is a world event that is not influenced by one man  when we complain of egg prices... it is a joke...  we are showing you what you sounded like when you blamed Biden for things he obviously couldnt control like inflation and oil prices
2025-02-17 20:59:31,That’s way more word reading than you’ve earned from me lol.

You're a true shining example, just a lone little sheep following the herd without even realizing it.   The same type of person who thinks auditing and holding our government accountable for years of wasteful spending and corruption at the tax payers expense is a bad thing bc thats what you've been told to think. You're more focused on whos leading the charge rather than whats actually being uncovered, because again, thats how youve been told to think by the ones who benefit from the very thing they're telling you to be mad about.

2025-02-18 00:09:01,Do you feel special now ?
2025-02-19 10:32:24,Um - no.  You did not use “proper English”.  You used English words but they are not used in a grammatically correct way.  We’ve already established that punctuation is too complicated for you.  I’m asking you to restate just one of your points using proper grammar.  If you can’t say them twice without “slipping” then they don’t have any substance.
2025-02-18 16:16:20,"Thanks for proving my point for me even more. 😂😂😂😂  Keep on projecting.  See look you already have all the answers.  It’s almost like that’s literally what I said before.

Have the day you deserve partna"
2025-02-20 00:04:51,"The guy is not so smarts and uses the same words over and over. “Echo chamber” and “dopamine” are his favorites. Maybe he’s a bot? If not, just another barely literate kult supporter."

2025-02-18 00:13:18,You asked “what?” As if there’s a misunderstanding. It’s not that deep princess. And nice assumptions lol
2025-02-17 21:04:49,You got it! I am still responding! You’re so observant <3
2025-02-18 00:13:47,"Lol, it’s funny how much you care about this."
2025-02-18 00:16:17,Again with your assumptions. Get better ammo than “you’re dumb” and “you care” my 5 year old shit talks better than this. You must just be starved for interaction and notifications
2025-02-18 00:16:55,Why are you putting so much effort into replying then lmaoooo.
2025-02-18 00:17:31,As opposed to what you’re doing ? lol ok chief
2025-02-18 00:17:53,Not my fault you can’t let it go
2025-02-18 00:21:01,"Says the guy that responded to me first out of thin air as if you opinion mattered, and continued to respond lol makes sense"
2025-02-18 00:22:58,Again with the whining. You sure you got a kid to raise? This is childish
2025-02-18 00:37:55,Stating the obvious is now whining. Sounds like you’re the one who can’t let stuff go and has to keep coming up with new stuff. Again seems a little attention starved/ dependent on notifications

2025-02-18 00:47:06,You’re totally right I clearly care and don’t enjoy talking shit/ wasting peoples energy in comment sections online . You’re the only person to have ever done it lmao no one can be similar to you in any way… “I do/enjoy something but it’s impossible for anyone else” head ass
2025-02-18 00:47:57,You’re just wasting your own time boss.
2025-02-18 00:57:47,"No, like I’ve stated 5+ times now I enjoy talking shit with and trolling in comment sections, so no. Plus it takes zero effort and 15 seconds to type 3 sentences. Especially when the other guys game is weak"

2025-06-04 17:01:46,After some days you will be $100k away from your target 😄😁
2025-06-04 18:07:02,Tbh I'll be honest crypto is dead. Crytpo as it exists right now was a great buy in 2009. All the money made was made in 2009. Other people who make money now in Crypto generally have the ability to dump money and be quiet about it when they lose and not suffer the consequences. Then they will pop and start screaming about how they made all the money they made. They were already on third base.   Like tbh just play the lottery once a day. If you spent 25k on lotto tickets across different kinds of tickets I'd be hard pressed to think you'd not at least break even lol.
2025-06-04 15:56:08,Feel it!
2025-06-04 15:57:07,How do you find the ones that are about to pop off?

A lot of the mechanical stuff is up there, gotta make sure snow/rain/water isn't seeping in somewhere it shouldn't be, and the rooftop offices were the most expensive. I know for a fact that unless you were literally sleeping on the edge of the building, we'd find you even in the middle of the night. And the doors up there have alarms we'd disable to do said security rounds, and they had NFC tags we had to scan to make sure we were doing them on time   So yah I would call it a case by case basis at best lol. Maybe aim for apartment building roofs or something"

Granted, AI has gotten quite good, but there are a lot of logically consistent little details to the image that make me think it's real, like the tar covered spackling knife nearby and how somebody labeled the bucket with spray paint (giant A for asphalt or adhesive, I'm guessing) usually because some idiot used the wrong thing one time and created a huge mess that took hours or days to undo. AI tends to be a bit more random with details."

2025-06-04 16:32:33,Just sharing in case people’s mooncoins don’t moon.
2025-06-04 16:11:47,All builds have access to the roof. They should have a stairway  So take elevator to the highest floor and find stairs leading up the top.  Make sure you’re able to open the door from the outside as to not lock yourself. I’ve seen one way doors since they’re emergency exits. Put something to wedge it so it doesn’t shut close

You can match the features of the rooftop in the foreground with the features you can see from satellite photos on Google maps.

2025-06-04 19:50:50,"see!  this is why i'm not rude to people. because, it turns out, I'M THE DOOFUS AFTER ALL. at least, i'm getting way too annoyed at this.  but yeah, people WILL confidently assume something and make claims outside their knowledge.  it's EXTREMELY frustrating to me. but not all misinformation is malicious i suppose."
